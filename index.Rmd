# About {-}

What is this book about? What for?

## How to use these exercises? 

- Besides the 14 lectures, the course will be organized around 12 non-graded exercises: 
  - 5 labs
  - 7 do-it-yourself (DIYS) 
- The labs' solutions will be discussed in detail between TAs and students in the corresponding sessions, while DIYS will not. In both cases, we will publish the solutions the week after the exercise is due.
- We encourage you to prepare for the lab sessions in advance as well as to attend them to discuss any doubts they might have related to the labs material. 
- To prevent redundant communications (i.e., emails with the same information), share your questions regarding the exercises in the forum. Labs will emphasize the most voted questions.
- While we encourage and foster a collaborative learning process, we expect you to work individually first.
  - I.e., try to address the task on your own first, identify what is limiting you, try to solve it on your own (not for too long), and, if you cannot find a solution, reach out your classmates. Once you find your solution, consider discussing the solution with your classmates.
