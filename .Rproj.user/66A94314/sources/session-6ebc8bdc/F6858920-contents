# About {-}

WHAT ABOUT IS THE BOOK?

## How to use these exercises? 

- Besides the 14 lectures, the course will be organized around 12 non-graded exercises: 
  - 5 labs
  - 7 do-it-yourself (DIYS) 
- The labs will be discussed with detail by TAs in the corresponding sessions, while the DIYS will not. In both cases, we will publish the solutions the week after the exercise is due.
- We encourage you to prepare for the lab sessions in advance as well as to attend them to discuss any doubts they might have related to the labs material. 
- To prevent redundant communications (i.e., emails with the same information), share your questions regarding the exercises in the forum. Labs will emphasize the most voted questions.
- While we encourage and foster a collaborative learning process, we expect you to work individually first.
  - I.e., try to address the task on your own first, identify what is limiting you, try to solve it on your own (not for too long), and, if you cannot find a solution, reach out your classmates. Once you find your solution, consider discussing the solution with your classmates.

# Week 1: DIYS 1

## Aim:

To refresh your R skills by performing some basic exploratory/descriptive analysis.

## Exercise

Please read the whole instruction before solving the exercise.

Each student will be randomly allocated to either doing the task 1 or 2 (a list containing those numbers will published). Both tasks are based on the same data sets. `f.txt` and `m.txt` contain information on the number of steps in a day and body mass index (BMI) for female and male individuals respectively.

Notes: 

- The details of the data origin will be published with the solution.
- Students allocated to each group are encouraged to do the task for the other group _only_ after finishing their own task.

### Task 1:
 - What do you conclude from the combined data set (i.e., the one formed using both the one for males and the one for females) regarding the relationship?
  - What questions did you ask yourself?
    - Why did you ask those questions? Is there an intuition behind them?
      - If so, what was your intuition?
      - If not, how did you proceed?


### Task 2:

- Is the average number of steps for males and females statistically different?
- How do BMI and daily steps statistically relate to each other?
  - Does that relationship depend on whether individuals are of one sex or another? If so, how?
    - Is there an statistically significant negative correlation between the number of steps and the BMI for females?
    - Is there an statistically significant positive correlation between the number of steps and the BMI for males?
  


- 1st weeks, dplier: to check> to statistical analysis
	- Doing basic code to make analysis (which is fine enough), but in dplier you could do it like this.
	- Make descriptive statistics using an interesting

looking for something unknown in the dark, grope, feel blindly and make conjectures on what things are and how they are related.
- Two groups: random selection: description similar? The smaller the group, the likelier that a random selection is not balanced? What about attrition?

Looking!=seeing:
  Different beliefs (non- and knowledge ones), different preferences, different attention focus -> different attention investment and emphasis
    Value of diverse academic community while keeping a minimal set of shared assessment rules: [objectivity](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-objectivity/) as continuum of increasing inter-subjective agreement
    
### Hints for both tasks:

- Before proceeding:
  
  1. Are there repeated ids within each data set?
  1. Make
  1. Unify both data sets in one object.
  2. Make sure you can distinguish the individual sex in the unified data set.
  3. Consider using the packages `dplyr`, ``

## Solution

Will be made available.

<!-- Here is the solution -->

```{r}
# open data
female <- read.table("~/Documents/0_IPZ/2023_2/Leemann-QuantMethods/QuantitativeMethods/QuantitativeMethods/Data/f.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# explore data
head(female)

# open data
male <- read.table("~/Documents/0_IPZ/2023_2/Leemann-QuantMethods/QuantitativeMethods/QuantitativeMethods/Data/m.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# explore data
head(male)
```


```{r}
# get package
# install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
```

## Exercise

- 2nd: simulated dataset and increase the variance: how does that affects the standard error


## Solution
