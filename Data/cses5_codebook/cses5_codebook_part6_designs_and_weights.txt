HOW TO CITE THE STUDY:

The Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (www.cses.org). CSES MODULE 5
FULL RELEASE [dataset and documentation]. July 25, 2023 version.

These materials are based on work supported by the American National
Science Foundation (www.nsf.gov) under grant numbers SES-1420973 and
SES-1760058, the GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, 
the University of Michigan, in-kind support of participating election
studies, the many organizations that sponsor planning meetings and 
conferences, and the numerous organizations that fund national 
election studies by CSES Collaborators.

Any opinions, findings and conclusions, or recommendations expressed
in these materials are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily
reflect the views of the funding organizations.

===========================================================================

NOTE TO USERS:

We recommend that researchers become familiar with the CSES design, units 
of analysis, documentation, and dataset weights before beginning their 
investigations. For instance, while the set of respondents appearing within
each election study represents their respective nations, the group of 
nations that appear within CSES is not a random sample of countries 
worldwide. Furthermore, while many election studies include 1,000 or so 
respondents, other election studies may consist of over 10,000 respondents. 
Some nations will have studies of more than one election in a CSES module,
and occasionally there will be two independent studies of a single 
election. Last, some election studies include oversamples of specific 
subpopulations or would otherwise benefit from use of the included weight
variables. We hope you find our website and documentation useful as you 
proceed with your work, and welcome any questions or suggestions you have.

))) OVERVIEW OF "CODEBOOK PART 6: STUDY DESIGNS AND WEIGHTS"
===========================================================================

Part 6 of the CSES Codebook provides users with general information about
the design of each election study included in MODULE 5, as well as the 
original polity level weights for each study. 
 
The purpose of these overviews is to provide users with a quick summary 
of the study and the weights, including information about the sample size, 
the fieldwork period, sample selection procedures, the mode(s) of interview,
and the language(s) the survey was administered in. 
 
For more detailed information about each study's design and its weights,
including information on response rates, refusal conversion, questionnaire
translation, respondent incentives etc., users are advised to consult 
the Design Reports for each polity included in the study which are available
on the CSES MODULE 5 Study Page:  
(see https://cses.org/data-download/cses-module-5-2016-2021/). 


===========================================================================
))) HOW TO NAVIGATE THE CSES MODULE 5 CODEBOOK
===========================================================================

In the CSES MODULE 5 dataset, all variables begin with the letter "E" 
(E being the fifth letter of the English alphabet and thus signifying 
MODULE 5).

The CSES Codebook is especially extensive and users are advised that the 
best way to navigate it is electronically. It is a .txt format which 
allows it to be accessed via a variety of programs. 

The CSES Codebook can be navigated quickly in the electronic files, with 
the following commands allowing for quick searching:

))) = Section Header. 

>>> = Sub-section Header 1.

<<>> = Sub-section Header 2. 

+++ = Tables.

CSES QUESTION CLASSIFICATION = For survey level variables only, CSES  
Question Classification details whether the variable is part of the CSES  
Core component, which are questions asked repeatedly in CSES Modules, 
whether a variable is part of the CSES Module Theme component, which are  
questions specific to the Module Theme under exploration and might not be 
included in CSES repeatedly, or whether a variable is a Derivative Variable, 
which is explained below. 

VARIABLES NOTES = Notes for particular variables. 

ELECTION STUDY NOTES = Notes for a particular election study.  

DERIVATIVE VARIABLE = Highlights a variable derived from another 
variable or variables within the CSES.

POTENTIAL POLITY LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging at polity level.

POTENTIAL REGIONAL LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging at regional level.

POTENTIAL TIME BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging by time.

POTENTIAL PARTY/COALITION LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = Highlights a variable
that may be used for data bridging at party/coalition level.

POTENTIAL CSES PRODUCT BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = Highlights a variable 
that may be used for data bridging with other CSES products.

For further details on the CSES MODULE 5 documentation, users are advised
to consult Part 1 of the CSES Codebook.

>>> MODULE 5 QUESTIONNAIRE VERSION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Studies included in the CSES MODULE 5 fielded one of two versions of the 
CSES questionnaire: the pilot questionnaire or the finalized questionnaire. 
While most studies (50 out of 56) fielded the finalized questionnaire, the 
pilot questionnaire was fielded by five studies in 2016 that administered
the preliminary version of the CSES questionnaire before the questionnaire
was finalized in September 2016 by the CSES Plenary. Additionally, Sweden
(2018) fielded the pilot questionnaire. 

Variable E1037 "QUESTIONNAIRE VERSION" in the Dataset classifies for Users
the studies that fielded the pilot version of the questionnaire and the
finalized questionnaire. 

The differences between the pilot and finalized questionnaire are documented 
in the VARIABLE NOTES in CSES Codebook Part 2. They are applicable to the
following variables: 
  - E2008         SOCIO ECONOMIC STATUS 
  - E2012         NUMBER IN HOUSEHOLD 
  - E3004_1_PT    ATTITUDES ABOUT ELITES: IMPORTANT TO SEEK COMPROMISE
  - E3004_8_PT    ATTITUDES ABOUT ELITES: POOR PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE GREATER 
                  VOICE
  - E3006_5_PT    NATIONAL IDENTITY: TO HAVE LIVED IN COUNTRY FOR MOST OF

>>> POLITY WEIGHTS IN CSES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSES provides users with up to three original weights from each 
national election study (see variable E1010_), namely:

  - SAMPLE WEIGHT (variable E1010_1): 
    intended to correct for unequal selection probabilities resulting from 
    booster samples procedures for selection within the household, 
    non-response, or other sample design features 

  - DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT (variable E1010_2): 
    intended to adjust sample distributions of socio-demographic 
    characteristics to more closely resemble the characteristics of the 
    population

  - POLITICAL WEIGHT (variable E1010_3): 
    intended to reconcile discrepancies in the reported electoral behavior
    of respondents vis-a-vis official electoral counts. 

Users are advised to read carefully about the different weights in CSES to 
ascertain whether their analyses should be subjected to weighting and if so 
which kind. The CSES project does not provide advice as to which weights 
are appropriate to use in particular circumstances. This is best left to 
analysts to decide based on their detailed knowledge of the research 
question under investigation. We advise analysts to consult each Polity's
Design Report on the CSES MODULE 5 Study Page (see
https://cses.org/data-download/cses-module-5-2016-2021/). 
For information on derivative weights calculated for the Cross-National 
Dataset, users should consult Parts 1 and 2 (variables E1011-E1014) 
of the CSES Codebook.

>>> DERIVATIVE WEIGHTS IN CSES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additionally to the original polity weights listed in the previous section
by national election study, CSES provides users with several derivative
weights, constructed from the original weights. They are: 
 
  - FACTOR WEIGHTS (variable E1011)
    These variables report the mean weight of each type, within each 
    polity. The resulting factors are then used to create the derivative 
    Polity Weights (E1012 explained below). 

  - POLITY WEIGHTS (variable E1012)
    These variables report standardized versions (with a mean of 1 within  
    the polity) of the original weights provided with the component election 
    studies, described in E1010. They are the ratio of each weighting 
    factor to the mean weight (E1011) of each type, calculated within each
    polity.

  - SAMPLE SIZE ADJUSTMENT WEIGHT (variable E1013)
    This variable reports the ratio of the average sample size to each 
    election study sample. The resulting factor is then used to create the
    derivative Dataset Weights, E1014. 

  - DATASET WEIGHTS (variable E1014)
    These variables are intended for micro-level analyses involving the 
    entire CSES sample. Using the sample size adjustment (E1013), the 
    centered weights (E1012) are corrected such that each election study
    component contributes equally to the analysis, regardless of the 
    original sample size. 

Details of the calculation of the above derivative weights, including 
the precise STATA code used to create the weights, can be found in the 
variable notes for variables E1011, E1012, E1013, and E1014 in Part 2 of
the CSES MODULE 5 Codebook.     

Analysts are advised to read the weight documentation carefully to ensure
their analyses are weighted appropriately (if applicable). The CSES 
project does not provide advice as to which weights are appropriate to 
use in particular circumstances. This is best left to analysts to decide 
based on their detailed knowledge of the research question under 
investigation. We advise analysts to consult variable notes E1011-E1014 
in Codebook Part 2 for more specific information on how the derivative 
weights were calculated for the Cross-National Dataset.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The 2017 Albanian Parliamentary elections were held on Sunday, June 25,
2017. Fieldwork for the post-election study was carried out between January 
20, 2018, and March 20, 2018 (60 days in total). The mode of interview was 
face-to-face using an electronic questionnaire. The questionnaire was 
administered in Albanian, and the fieldwork was administered by the 
ASSA-Zeitgeist based in Tirana, Albania. The total number of observations 
from the Albania Study is 1,255 interviews.

The study interviewed respondents who were eligible to vote in 2017
Parliamentary elections, namely, Albanian citizens who are 18+ years old.
Collaborators estimate that around 2% of the population was excluded from
the sample, including those institutionalized during the fieldwork. A random
probability sample was used for the study, and the sample covered whole
Albania. Polling stations were used as primary sampling units (PSUs). In
total, 267 PSUs were selected, stratified by regions and rural-urban
location. In all PSUs, eight interviews were planned, one per household. In
urban areas, 1 out of 10 households was selected, while in rural areas, it
was 1 out of 5, and in those rural areas with low density, it was 1 out of 3
households. The person interviewed within the household was selected
randomly, following the last birthday rule. In instances when the person
chosen was not available on the first visit, two more extra visits were 
paid. The selected person was not replaced in case of no contact, even after 
the third visit.

>>> OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND WEIGHTS - AUSTRALIA (2019)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The 2019 Federal election in Australia occurred on Saturday, May 18, 2019.
Fieldwork for the Australian study began on June 3, 2019, 16 days after 
election day. Data collection was completed after 15 days, ending on June
17, 2019. The study, undertaken by Australian National University (ANU) in
Canberra, was conducted as part of wave 28 of the Social Research Center's 
Life in Australia panel. Members of the panel are Australian residents aged 
18 years or more. A total of 2,676 active panel members were invited to 
participate in the study, and the total number of observations from the
Australia Study is 2,000 interviews. The survey was administered in 
English. The study used a mixed-mode approach, including both Internet and 
telephone (landline and cell) surveys. Respondents were initially contacted 
and recruited via their landline or mobile phone and offered to complete the
questionnaire online. Still, they could self-select into the alternative 
mode and complete the study via telephone if they were uncomfortable  
completing surveys over the Internet or if Internet access was problematic. 

A dual-frame random digit dialing (RDD) sample design was employed to
undertake recruitment of the Life in Australia panel in 2016, with a 30:70
split between the landline RDD sample frame and a cell phone RDD sample
frame. An alternating next/last birthday method was used for the landline 
phone sample to randomly select respondents from households with two or more 
in-scope persons. For the cell phone sample, the individual who answered the 
call was the selected respondent. 
Only one member per household was invited to join the panel. In May 2018, 
the panel was refreshed with 267 new panelists. For both the recruitment in 
2016 and panel refreshment in 2018, the RDD sample was provided by 
SamplePages. 

Panelists receive a small incentive to join the panel and another incentive 
for each survey they complete. For the Australian (2019) study, all 
respondents were offered a 10 Australian dollars (AUD) incentive, and they 
had a choice to either collect the money or transfer it as a charitable 
donation to a designated charity.


<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS

The 2019 Australia Study provides a COMBINED SAMPLE and DEMOGRAPHIC 
WEIGHT. This weight adjusts for the unequal probability of selection. 
Since some units in the population may not have a chance of selection 
(for instance, persons without a telephone have no chance of selection 
for a telephone survey) and there may be different rates of response across
unit characteristics, sample weights reduce the extent of any biases 
introduced through non-coverage. Weights are constructed in the following 
two steps:
1. Compute a base weight for each respondent as the product of two weights:
a. their enrollment weight, accounting for the initial chances of selection
and subsequent post-stratification to key demographic benchmarks;
b. their response propensity weight, estimated from enrollment information
available for both respondents and non-respondents to the present wave.
2. Calibrate the base weights so that they satisfy the latest population
benchmarks for several demographic characteristics.

The 2017 Austrian Federal lower house election was held on Sunday, 
October 15, 2017. Fieldwork for the study began on October 19, 2017, lasting 
42 days, with completion on November 30, 2017. All interviews were conducted 
by IPR Umfrageforschung via telephone (mobile and landline). Surveys were 
administered in German. The total number of observations from the Austria 
Study is 1,203 interviews.

The sample is meant to be representative of all eligible voters in Austria 
as of election day (Austrian citizens aged 16 or older). The primary 
sampling units were Austrian municipalities, all of which were included in 
the first stage of the sampling procedure. The sampling procedure included
two further stages, namely, at the household and respondent level. 
Households within the municipalities were randomly selected (proportional 
to the size of the municipality), using a dual-frame (50% list frame and 
50% random digit dial). Within households, the target person was randomly
selected using the next-birthday method.

The 2017 Austria Study provides a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT and a COMBINED 
DEMOGRAPHIC and POLITICAL WEIGHT.
The demographic weight (E1010_2) adjusts the sample to match known 
demographic characteristics in the voting age population (age, gender, 
education, region, household size, and employment type). The political 
weight (E1010_3) is a combined weight that adjusts the sample to 
match the national election results on top of the demographic weight. The 
combined weight E1010_3 is a winsorized weight in which upper and lower 
boundaries were determined by the field institute.

>>> OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND WEIGHTS - BELGIUM-FLANDERS (2019)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The 2019 Federal elections in Belgium were held on Sunday, May 26, 2019. The 
study had two dimensions: a component designed to capture a representative 
sample of French speakers and a component designed to capture a 
representative sample of Dutch speakers. These two components are mapped 
onto Belgium's two principal regions - Wallonia, composed principally of 
French primary speakers, and Flanders, composed primarily of Dutch speakers.
Consequently, separate samples were drawn for both Belgium-Wallonia and 
Belgium-Flanders, which also captures the fact that both regions 
have substantially different political configurations, with
different political actors contesting each region, and most parties 
contesting one of the regions only. The Belgium-Flanders sample is 
representative of the eligible voting population residing in 
Belgium-Flanders only (i.e., electoral regions of Antwerp, East Flanders, 
Flemish Brabant, Limburg, and West Flanders). 

Fieldwork for the Belgium-Flanders component of the Belgian study began 
three days after the election, on May 29, 2019. Data collection ended after 
119 days, on September 24, 2019, with the total number of observations 
from the Belgium-Flanders Study being 1,084 interviews. The study employed 
a mixed-mode approach, with respondents having the option to self-select 
into a mail-back survey or to participate in the survey via the Internet. 
Respondents in Belgium-Wallonia received the Dutch questionnaire. 
KU Leuven, Center for Political Research, conducted the fieldwork.

All respondents had to be Belgium citizens with registered residence in
Flanders and eligible to vote in the Belgian federal elections. Belgium
citizens living in foreign countries have the right to vote but
were not sampled for the election study. Also, voters above 85 years old
were not approached to participate. This group comprises between 2 and 3 
percent of the population in Flanders.
A random selection of 4,000 voters in Flanders was selected by the Belgian
National Register and drawn from their National Register of all voters in
Flanders. The Belgian National Register made the random selection due
to strict privacy regulations. The entire sample of 4,000 voters was used in
the initial approach, and all drawn voters were invited to fill out the
questionnaire.


<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS

The 2019 Belgium-Flanders Study provides a DEMOGRAPHIC and a COMBINED 
POLITICAL and DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT. The weights were created using the 
IPF-procedure in STATA.
The demographic weight (E1010_2) was constructed based on the most recent
available data for age, gender, and education level.
The political weight (E1010_3) includes the same variables as the 
demographic weight, and the vote choice as reported by the respondents
compared to the official election results. Where necessary, Collaborators 
calculated distributions themselves to make sure all information was correct
for the specific geographical region. Available information was subdivided 
by age so that the distributions are corrected for the population older than
18 (which should give a better estimate for educational level, for example).

representative of the eligible voting population residing in 
Belgium-Wallonia only (i.e., electoral regions of Brabant, Hainaut, Liege, 
Luxembourg, and Namur). The Belgium-Capital Region (Brussels), which is 
principally French-speaking is deliberately not sampled because of 
logistical challenges in the implementation of the study - principally its 
geographic location within the Flanders region, and the challenges of 
distributing the appropriate language mail-back questionnaire to respondents
as a result.  

Fieldwork for the Belgium-Wallonia component of the Belgian study began 
three days after the election, on May 29, 2019. Data collection ended after 
119 days, on September 24, 2019, with the total number of observations 
from the Belgium-Flanders Study being 730 interviews. The study employed a 
mixed-mode approach, with respondents having the option to self-select into

Wallonia. The Belgian National Register made the random selection due
to strict privacy regulations. The entire sample of 4,000 voters was used
in the initial approach, and all drawn voters were invited to fill out the
questionnaire.

The 2019 Belgium-Wallonia Study provides a DEMOGRAPHIC and a COMBINED 
POLITICAL and DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT. The weights were created using the 
IPF-procedure in STATA.
The demographic weight (E1010_2) was constructed based on the most recent
available data for age, gender, and education level.
The political weight (E1010_3) includes the same variables as the
demographic weight, and the vote choice as reported by the respondents
compared to the official election results. Where necessary, Collaborators 
calculated distributions themselves to make sure all information was correct
for the specific geographical region. Available information was subdivided 
by age so that the distributions are corrected for the population older than
18 (which should give a better estimate for educational level, for example).

The 2018 Brazilian general elections were held on Sunday, October 7, 2018 
(first round) with a second round of Presidential elections on Sunday, 
October 28, 2018. The Brazilian Election Study was conducted between 
November 10 and November 14, 2018. Fieldwork lasted 15 days, starting 34 
days after the first round. IBOPE Inteligencia of Sao Paolo collected data 
in face-to-face interviews using an electronic questionnaire. 
Interviewing was conducted in Portuguese, with all Brazilian citizens aged 
16 years old and older and registered to vote eligible to be interviewed. 
The total number of observations from the Brazil Study is 2,506 interviews.

The sample for the Brazilian study is stratified per state. In the case of
states with metropolitan areas, its universe is stratified in metropolitan
areas and the countryside. The cities, which constitute the primary sampling 
units, were probabilistically selected in each stratum in the first step 
through a systematic PPS (Probability Proportional to Size) method. By this
method, 172 cities were selected. In the second stage, census tracts were
selected with systematic PPS. In the third stage, a fixed number of 
respondents were selected within each sampled tract according to quotas 
based on gender, age, education, line of work, and the number of bathrooms
in the household. These quotas were set considering the census update survey
from IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) 2010, PNADC 2016
(National Survey by Household Sample) and TSE 2018 (Superior Electoral
Court). The households to be contacted within census tracts were chosen by
random walk.

>>> OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND WEIGHTS - CANADA (2019)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The 43rd Canadian general election took place on Monday, October 21, 2019. 
The Canadian Election Study comprised a post-election survey fielded 
between October 22, 2019, and November 21, 2019 (lasting 31 days), although
some respondent demographic information was collected in pre-election
interviews. The data was collected by the organization Advantis Inc and
data collection was funded by the Social Science and Research Council of
Canada and archived by the Canadian Opinion Research Archive.

The fieldwork for the survey was conducted by telephone and the Internet, 
(mixed-mode approach) although all information gathered pre-election was 
collected via telephone between September 10 and October 20, 2019. 
All 4,021 respondents were called or e-mailed after the election according
to their stated preference and asked to complete the post-election survey. 
Hence, respondents could self-select into modes for the post-election 
interview. Fieldwork commenced on October 22, 2019, and finished on November
21, 2019, with 2,889 respondents participating (72% of the original sample). 
72% (2,067 respondents) participated via telephone, while the remaining 28%
(822 respondents) did so online, with an attrition rate of 28% vis-a-vis 
the pre-election sample. 

Interviews were conducted in English and in French, and the sample is 
designed to be representative of the Canadian population aged 18 years and 
older in the ten Canadian provinces. The territories, namely 
Northwest Territories, Yukon Territory, and Nunavut, were excluded from the 
sampling frame, in line with previous Canadian Election Studies. The 
population of those areas is approximately 0.3%. Non-residential respondents 
were excluded as well (0.2%). As the interviews were conducted by telephone, 
another 0.7% of the population without a phone could not be reached. In sum, 
it is estimated that 1.2% of the population was excluded from the sampling
frame. 

Respondents were selected by modified random digit dialing and a birthday 
selection method within households. If there was more than one eligible 
person in the household at a landline phone number, the person with the next
birthday was requested as the survey respondent. The birthday selection 
method was used as it ensures a random selection of respondents and is a 
much less intrusive way to start an interview than asking about the number 
of people in the household, thus making it easier for the interviewer to 
secure the respondent's cooperation. The sample was stratified by province, 
targeting 20% of the sample from each of Ontario, Quebec, the Prairies 
(Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta), the Atlantic provinces (divided evenly
among Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland) and
British Columbia.


<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS 

The 2019 Canada Study provides a COMBINED SAMPLE and DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT 
for the post-election survey. The Collaborators decided the weight is
required due to the stratification and the dual-frame (cell/landline phone) 
design.
In order to produce national estimates, it was necessary to correct for both
the province of residence and the phone ownership type, as these are both 
factors that influenced the sample design for the Canadian Election Study. 
In order to determine the phone ownership type and hence the probability of
inclusion of a particular respondent in the study, each respondent was 
asked at the end of the pre-election survey if they had a wireless phone 
(if they completed on landline) or a landline phone (if they completed on 
wireless). Respondents were then assigned an ownership type of landline 
only, wireless only, both, or refused/don't know. Population proportions 
among the ten provinces were taken from the 2016 Census and 2017 data for 
phone ownership by province was used to create a joint probability for 
phone ownership among each of the provinces. Respondents who refused to 
provide details about their phone ownership were given a phone ownership 
type population proportion equal to their sample proportion within 
province, so as not to artificially create population proportions for this 
subset. Weights are calculated by dividing the population proportion by the
sample proportion for each subgroup so that each is "adjusted up" or 
"adjusted down" in the overall picture to provide a sample distribution 
representative of the joint population proportion on the province and phone
ownership metrics.

The Chilean general elections were held on Sunday, November 19, 2017, with
parliamentary elections to the lower and upper houses and the first round 
of Presidential elections. A second round of Presidential elections followed
on December 17, 2017. The fieldwork for the Chilean study started one day 
after Round 2 of the Presidential elections (December 18, 2017), lasting 
until January 31, 2018 (45 days). Fieldwork was carried out by the agency
Feedback, based in Santiago, Chile. The survey was fielded in Spanish, with 
face-to-face interviewing using a paper questionnaire. The total number of 
observations from the Chile Study is 2,000 interviews.

The Chilean 2017 study is meant to be representative of all citizens of 
Chile aged 18 years living in Chile, including immigrants with at least 
five years of residence, which is a requirement to get the right to vote 
in Chile.
The sample for the study was created in four stages. In the first stage,
primary sampling units ("communas") were selected. These are the smallest
administrative units in Chile. They were ordered by size, and every comuna
with 50,000 inhabitants or more was automatically selected. Additionally,
a sample of 22 comunas (with less than 50,000 inhabitants) was randomly
selected. In the second stage, blocks inside the communas were selected 
using stratified random sampling, with a probability of selection 
proportional to the size of the blocks. In the third stage, households 
within blocks were selected using random systematic sampling procedures. 
Finally, respondents within households were selected using a Kish table.

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The 2018 Costa Rica general election occurred on Sunday, February 4, 2018. 
The post-election study was fielded between February 27, 2019, and March 6, 
2019 (8 days), with fieldwork commencing 388 days after election day. 
The Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP) funded the data 
collection, with fieldwork administered by the Political Studies and 
Research Center (CIEP) at the University of Costa Rica. The total number of 
observations from the Costa Rica Study is 1,456 interviews.

Interviews were conducted in Spanish via the telephone. Costa Ricans without 
access to a cell phone were excluded from the sampling frame (estimated to
be 2.5% of the eligible population). Additionally, voters abroad are not
included in the sampling frame, but there are no official estimates about
the impact of this exclusion on the sampling frame. 

The sampling frame is derived from Superintendence of Telecommunications
(SUTEL), which publishes a list of cell phone numbers potentially for use 
by cell phone operators in Costa Rica. These potential numbers form 
the sampling units for the study. As the study was sampling individuals 
assigned as owner of a cell phone number, it was theoretically possible 
for more than one person in a single household to be interviewed. 
Collaborators applied a formula that randomized numbers from the interval
of each operator, with a stratification procedure applied taking into
account the market share of each operator. Applying this procedure to 
the SUTEL database, fifteen thousand potential cell phone numbers were 
generated. Approximately 70% of these numbers were found to be inactive. Of 
the remaining 4,570 numbers found to be valid, a sample was drawn, with 
three contact attempts made to each number telephoned. Calls were made to 
the numbers at different times of the day over a twelve-hour period. 


<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS 

The 2018 Costa Rica Study provides a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT. The weight was 
constructed after Collaborators compared expected values of demographic 
characteristics (gender, age and education) of the general population to the 
sample population. The expected values of those characteristics of the 
population were obtained from the National Household Survey. Collaborators 
found that over- and under-representation in the survey were related to the 
educational level. Respondents with higher education, namely university 
degrees, were over-represented compared to those with lower education, 
namely primary education.
The weight adjusts for educational differences. The weight was constructed
by dividing the value obtained in the sample by the expected value of the 
population. For those respondents for whom no information on their 
education is available, the demographic weight is coded 1.

needs to be an inhabitant of Czechia and above 18 years old, the eligible
age to vote. The sample did not include people without a house or an 
apartment to live in, about 1% of the eligible population. The survey 
involved a quota sampling approach. Quotas were designed for each of the 
14 electoral constituencies based on age, sex and education. Interviewers
selected respondents in their county area based on fulfilling the quota 
without further specifications. Hence, interviewers could technically 
contact any address in the area. If a contacted person refused to take part

eligible voters in Denmark - Danish citizens aged 18 and older who are
registered to vote automatically if they permanently live in Denmark. The
total number of observations from the Denmark Study is 1,418 interviews.

The study is based on a simple random sample drawn from the Danish person 
register ("CPR-register") wherein all Danish citizens and long-term 
inhabitants of Denmark must be registered. Hence, individuals were the 
primary sampling unit and had the same probability of being selected. 
Respondents were initially contacted via both postal and "digital mail". 
With few exceptions, digital mail is mandatory for Danish citizens. 
The survey was personally sent to respondents by the Danish digital post and 
verified by a personal access coding system. To increase response rates, 
Collaborators conducted a lottery among all survey participants. Respondents
could win gift cards with a total value of 75,000 DKK.

The 2019 El Salvador Presidential elections were held on Sunday, February 3, 
2019. The post-election survey was fielded between July 4, 2019, and July 
24, 2019 (21 days in total). The survey was administered in Spanish, and the 
fieldwork was carried out by the Fundacion Dr. Guillermo Manuel Ungo 
(FUNDAUNGO). The surveys were conducted face-to-face using an electronic 
questionnaire. The total number of observations from the El Salvador Study 
is 1,488 interviews.  

A person needed to be an inhabitant of El Salvador and above 18 years old 
to be interviewed. The sample did not include institutionalized people, 
about 0.9% of the eligible population, and military personnel, about 0.45%
of the eligible population. 
The survey employed a stratified random sample. In the stratified two-stage 
sample, the primary sample unit was made up of the census segments and the 
second one of the qualified respondents within the census segments. Within 
each census segment, participants were selected by age and gender, according 
to the national population distribution. The primary sampling units were 
census segments selected by simple systematic random sampling. The secondary
sampling units were households. Within each census segment, six households 
were selected, in which one person completed the interview. The six 
respondents were selected and interviewed according to gender and age quotas
determined in accordance with the national population distribution. The 
sample design also included stratification, as the population was divided 
into geographic areas (urban and rural). Within each geographic area, random

The 2019 Finnish Parliamentary elections were held on Sunday, April 14,
2019. Fieldwork for the Finnish election study began three days after the
election, on April 17, 2019. After 172 days, on October 5, 2019, data
collection was completed, with the total number of observations from the 
Finnish Study being 1,598 interviews. Market research company Taloustutkimus 
Oy conducted the fieldwork, which was initially implemented using 
face-to-face interviews using an electronic questionnaire (although a 
subsequent contact by telephone for some respondents was required later - 
see below for more information). Hence, the study is classified as using a
mixed-mode approach. The survey was administered in Finnish and Swedish. 
Respondents were citizens living in Finland who had the right to vote in 
the Finnish 2019 parliamentary elections (18 years old and older). Citizens
from Aland Islands were excluded from the sample (approximately 0.65% of 
the population in Finland).

The sampling method was random route sampling within primary sampling units
used as starting points. ZIP codes were used as primary sampling units (PSU)
and these were randomly selected within each stratum. The sample was
stratified according to Eurostat NUTS-3 regions and degrees of urbanization
(DEGURBA) and allocated to quotas based on gender, age, area, and degree of
urbanization. The number of interviews was distributed to each stratum in
proportion to the 18+ population in each stratum. Overall, 12,442
households were in the sample. Households were selected so that the
interviewer was assigned a random starting address within the PSU. Then
interviewers selected households randomly. The interviewer screened
household members at the beginning of the interview. If the selected
respondent fitted the quotas, he/she was eligible for an interview. If an
individual refused to participate in the interview, another respondent was 
recruited using random route sampling.

A telephone follow-up with some respondents after the initial fielding 
of the survey was required due to a programming error by the data
collection organization. This error impacted two CSES measures, namely, 
turnout and vote choice variables. To alleviate the issue to the extent
possible, the fieldwork agency attempted to recontact respondents by 
telephone impacted by this error (N=288) to ask these respondents the 
questions that had not been included in the original interview. These 
respondents were not required to re-do the entire interview, merely the 
missing questions. Consequently, 173 respondents are classified as having
completed the interview in a mixed-mode fashion. For more information,
please consult ELECTION STUDY NOTES for Finland (2019) for variable E1007

The 2017 French Presidential elections were held across two rounds: The
first round was held on Sunday, April 23, 2017, and the second-round 
run-off held on Sunday, May 7, 2017. Interviewing for the French election 
study began on May 9, 2017 (two days after Round 2 of the Presidential 
elections) and continued until May 23, 2017, for a total of 15 days. 
Kantar Public conducted fieldwork, and the survey was administered in 
French, face-to-face using an electronic questionnaire. The total number of 
observations from the France Study is 1,830 interviews. 

The sample is meant to be representative of the voting-eligible population,
i.e., French citizens who were 18 years or older at the time of the election
and registered to vote. Institutionalized persons were excluded from the 
sample, as were citizens living in the overseas territories due to 
cost considerations.

The sample was realized as a two-stage stratified quota sample. 
Stratification was based on a matrix cross-tabulating eight regions and four
different types of agglomeration (with Paris and its suburbs forming one of
these four categories). From the resulting matrix with 29 valid cells, 100
primary sampling units were randomly selected at the electoral district 
level (circonscriptions).
Within the selected circonscriptions, interviewers were instructed to follow
random routes starting from a random departure point within the district, 
including instructions on how to navigate through roads, intersections, 
city blocks, buildings, and mailboxes.

In the second stage, respondents were selected to match predefined quotas 
for gender (two categories), age (five categories), level of education (four
categories), and a combination of occupation (retired or not) and profession
(six categories). Quotas were designed to match the latest available data 
from official statistical sources, with one exception: For education, 
quotas deliberately underrepresent the lowest education level, reflecting 
differences in voter registration patterns based on education.
For each of the 100 primary sampling units, Collaborators aimed for 18 
interviews.

The 2017 German Federal election was held on Sunday, September 24, 2017. 
The CSES survey was part of the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES) 
post-election cross-sectional component. Fieldwork was administered between 
September 25 and November 30, 2017 (67 days in total) by Infratest dimap 
Gesellschaft fuer Trend-und Wahlforschung GmbH. The survey was administered 
in German face-to-face using an electronic questionnaire. The total number 
of observations from the Germany Study is 2,032 interviews.  

The sample is designed to be representative of all German citizens with 
registered residence in Germany, aged 16 and older, who would be eligible 
to vote in the German Federal elections by polling day. The CSES sample 
includes respondents aged 18 or over by election day. Residents of islands 
without land connection and institutionalized persons were excluded from the 
sampling frame (together, less than 0.3% of the eligible population). 

The survey employed a two-stage stratified random sampling procedure based 
on resident registers. The primary sampling units were 162 randomly 
selected sampling points (108 in Western Germany, 54 in Eastern Germany). 
The sampling points corresponded to a set number of addresses to be 
selected in the respective municipality during the second stage. Sampling 
points were allocated to municipalities following a Cox algorithm. Because 
of the designed oversampling of Eastern Germans, this procedure was 
conducted separately for Eastern and Western Germany. The allocation 
procedure of sampling points to municipalities accounted for stratification 
along regional criteria. Larger municipalities could be allocated multiple 
sampling points. After the allocation, a total of 162 sampling points were 
selected by a systematic drawing procedure with random starts for each 
regional stratum. In case multiple sampling points were drawn in a 
municipality, the number of addresses selected was increased accordingly. 
In the second stage, individual respondents were selected from the sampled 
municipalities. The raw sample of respondents was drawn randomly from the 
pre-selected municipalities. The selection made use of the state resident 
register. Again, the procedure used stratification with an age-group x 
gender-structure matrix. Large municipalities (100,000 inhabitants and 
above) selected in the first stage were divided into up to 12 spatial 
clusters. Out of those, four were randomly selected to be included in the 
individual sampling procedure of the second stage.

self-select into two self-administered modes (mixed-mode approach), namely: 
an Internet survey and a self-completion mail-back questionnaire. 
To encourage participation in the Internet segment, Collaborators employed a

In cases where multiple sampling points were drawn within a municipality, 
the number of addresses selected was increased accordingly. 
In the second stage, individual respondents were selected from the sampled 
municipalities. The raw sample was drawn randomly from the pre-selected
municipalities based on state resident registers. Again, the procedure used
stratification with an age-group x gender-structure matrix. Large 
municipalities (100,000 inhabitants and above) selected in the first stage
were split into up to 12 spatial clusters. Out of those, four were randomly
selected to be included in the individual sampling procedure of the second
stage. Sampled individuals were invited to the survey by mail. 
Invitation letters included a link to the online version of the 
questionnaire. All persons within the sample received an unconditional 
pre-paid incentive of 5 EUR and up to two reminders.

The 2021 Germany Study provides a SAMPLE WEIGHT and a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT. 
The sample weight is designed to account for the oversampling of East 
Germans. The demographic weight adjusts the sample to known population 
distributions regarding gender, age, educational attainment, functional 
regional centrality/periphery, and residence in Eastern or Western Germany. 
Weights were calculated through iterative proportional fitting (IPF). 
Hence, the weighting factors calculated at each step were used as the basis
for the respective following steps. Excessively large individual weighting 
factors were avoided by trimming to a set maximum after each step.

The 2017 British general election took place on Thursday, June 8, 2017. 
The post-election survey, part of the larger British Election Study (BES), 
was fielded between June 26, 2017, and October 2, 2017, lasting 96 days. 
The data was collected by a consortium of three fieldwork agencies: Gfk, 
Kantar Public, and NatCen. The fieldwork was coordinated by Gfk. 

The survey was principally administered face-to-face using an electronic 
questionnaire, although some CSES questions were included in the self-
completion questionnaire, which respondents could choose to self-complete  
and mail-back or do so via the Internet (i.e., mixed-mode). Hence, 
respondents could self-select into interview modes for the supplementary 
questionnaire. The survey was administered in English, with the total number
of observations from the Britain Study being 984 interviews (37% of which 
were a mix of face-to-face and mail self-completion, and the remaining 63%
a mix of face-to-face and the Internet). 

The sample is representative of the population of 18 years and older 
inhabitants living in Great Britain who were eligible to vote in the 2017 
election. Those who are eligible to vote are British citizens, citizens of 
the Republic of Ireland and citizens of a Commonwealth country with the 
right to remain in the UK. The sampling frame is restricted to mainland
Britain and does not include Northern Ireland or any other island territory,
estimated to be less than 0.25% of the eligible population. The sample frame 
also omitted institutionalized people, defined here as individuals who
in incarceration, persons in residential care, or military personnel based
overseas), as the sample was drawn from the Small User Postcode Address File 
(PAF), which does not include these individuals. 

The sample was selected based on a multi-stage design based on: (1) a 
stratified random sample of 234 Parliamentary constituencies in mainland 
Britain; (2) two Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) per constituency 
which were selected with probability proportional to size, (3) selection of 
addresses from the Small User Postcode Address File (PAF), and (4) one 
individual randomly selected per address by the interviewer. 
The primary sampling units are parliamentary constituencies in mainland
Britain (234 from 630 were sampled). In the first stage, the constituencies 
were stratified by country and then (within England) by Region. Within each 
country/region, constituencies were classified by party competition, defined 
as a combination of winning party and party competition from the 2010 
election. The final stage of stratification was to sort the constituencies 
within each cell from the least to the most marginal. The constituencies 
were then selected with probability proportional to population size.
At each address, the interviewer established the number of dwellings, then 
households, and finally people aged 18 or over who were eligible to vote in 
the general election. At each of these levels, if there was more than one 
unit present, one was selected by the interviewer using a Kish grid, 
randomized for each address. Respondents received a gift voucher between 
10 GBP and 25 GBP for their participation.

The 2017 Great Britain Study provides a COMBINED SAMPLE and DEMOGRAPHIC 
WEIGHT. 
There were two weights that were applied: selection weights to correct for
unequal selection probabilities and post-stratification weights, accounting
for differing levels of response from various groups in the population.
The combined weight included in CSES was constructed after Collaborators
found several demographics need to be considered for the non-response
weighting. They decided that the demographics that should be corrected were
age, gender, and region. The targets for these were taken from the Office 
for National Statistics (ONS) mid-year population estimates, and weights 
were calculated after the selection weights had been applied.

The 2019 British general election took place on Thursday, December 12, 2019.  
The post-election survey, part of the larger British Election Study (BES), 
was fielded between December 21, 2019, and July 13, 2020. The election took
place before the COVID-19 pandemic declared on March 11, 2020. However, 
fieldwork was partially conducted during the pandemic, lasting longer than 
initially anticipated and involving a mixed-mode strategy due to COVID-19 
pandemic restrictions. 

Fieldwork was administered by a consortium of two fieldwork agencies: 
Ipsos and NatCen. Fieldwork commenced nine days after polling day on 
December 21, 2019, and lasted 206 days, with the survey administered in 
English. Initially, the mode of interview was planned to be in-person using 
an electronic questionnaire. However, when lockdown restrictions arising 
from the COVID-19 pandemic were implemented in Britain in spring 2020, the 
study adopted a mixed-mode approach, with a push-to-mail and push-to-
Internet strategy. Hence, respondents could self-select into self-
administered interview modes. Twenty-two percent (573 respondents) of the 
sample in part responded to the survey face-to-face using an electronic 
questionnaire. The remaining segment of the sample (1,914 respondents) were
interviewed via the Internet or self-completion mail questionnaire or a 
mixture of face-to-face (electronic questionnaire), and Internet or self-
completion mail. The total number of observations from the Britain Study is
2,537 interviews. 

The sample is representative of the population of 18 years and older 
inhabitants living in Great Britain who were eligible to vote in the 2019 
election. Those who are eligible to vote are British citizens, citizens of 
the Republic of Ireland and citizens of a Commonwealth country with the 
right to remain in the UK. The sampling frame is restricted to mainland
Britain and does not include Northern Ireland or any other island territory,
estimated to be less than 0.25% of the eligible population. The sample frame 
also omitted institutionalized people, defined here as individuals who were
in incarceration, persons in residential care, or military personnel based
overseas), as the sample was drawn from the Small User Postcode Address File 
(PAF), which does not include these individuals. 
The sample was selected based on a multi-stage design based on (1) a 
stratified random sample of 400 Parliamentary constituencies, (2) two Lower 
Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) per constituency, which were selected with  
probability proportional to size, (3) selection of addresses from the Small  
User PAF, and (4) one individual randomly selected per address by the 
interviewer. The primary sampling units are parliamentary constituencies in 
mainland Britain (400 out of 630 are sampled). 

In the first stage, the constituencies were stratified by country and then 
(within England) by Region. Within each country/region, constituencies were
classified by party competition, defined as a combination of winning party 
and party competition from the 2010 election. The final stage of

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

Parliamentary elections in Greece were held on Sunday, September 20, 2015.
This post-election cross-sectional study fielded the CSES MODULE 5 pilot 
questionnaire. The fieldwork started 39 days after the election and ran 
from October 29, 2015, to February 29, 2016 (106 days in total). Data 
collection was conducted by the School of Political Sciences at the 
Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The survey was fielded in Greek and 
is meant to be representative of all Greek citizens with voting rights (18
years of age and older). The study employed a mixed-mode approach: telephone 
and Internet. Respondents were recruited via telephone and offered to
complete the survey via either mode if they did not have an e-mail address 
or Internet access. Hence, respondents could self-select into interview 
modes. With this recruitment procedure, approximately 18% of households in
Greece were excluded because they did not have a phone. The total number of
observations from the Greece Study is 1,078 interviews.

The geographical area was sampled at the first stage, and the area code was
identified. In stage two, the telephone numbers were selected by random
sampling. Random Digital Dialing (RDD) method was used to select
respondents for the study. The individual who answered the phone call was
asked to participate in the survey after verifying that they were eligible 
to vote. If the respondent had an e-mail address, he/she would be
encouraged to fill out the questionnaire online. If the respondent had no
e-mail address or Internet access, they would be offered a telephone
interview. More than 800 respondents from the study conducted after the
January 2015 elections said they were willing to participate again. They
were also contacted, either via e-mail or via telephone. Up to four 
follow-up reminders were sent through email to all the respondents to
increase the response rate of the survey.

The 2015 Greece Study provides a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT. The Weight was
constructed using the method of raking on gender, age and education. With
post-stratification, the population was partitioned into subgroups, then the
original weights (in Greek case all equal to one) were multiplied by a 
ratio which was formed by the corresponding population post-stratum size 
in the nominator and the corresponding sample post-stratum size in the 
denominator. Raking allows multiple grouping variables to be used by 
post-stratifying on each variable in turn, and the process was repeated 
until the weights stopped changing.

The 2019 Greek Parliamentary election was held on Sunday, July 7, 2019. 
The 2019 Greek study was a post-election cross-sectional Internet survey 
that was conducted between December 12, 2019, and March 7, 2020 (96 days 
in total). The survey was administered in Greek and the School of Political 
Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki was responsible for data 
collection. The total number of observations from the Greece Study is 1,324 
interviews. 

The sample is meant to be representative of registered voters, that is, 
Greek citizens aged 17 or above. Respondents were recruited via random digit 
dialing of mobile phone numbers, such that individuals were the primary 
sampling unit. Before their inclusion into the sampling frame, Collaborators 
verified mobile phone numbers were active. Respondents not owning a personal
mobile phone were excluded from the sampling frame (about 1% of the total 
eligible population according to a 2021 Eurobarometer survey). 
The individual who answered the phone call was asked to participate in the
online survey after verifying their eligibility to vote. Collaborators 
initially planned on offering alternative modes but eventually refrained 
from doing so after contacting about one-third of sample members, as less 
than 1% preferred a different mode to Internet interviews. Up to four 
follow-up reminders were sent through SMS to all respondents to increase 
the survey's response rate.

The 2016 elections to the Hong Kong Legislative Council (LegCo) were held
on Sunday, September 4, 2016. This post-election cross-sectional study 
fielded the CSES MODULE 5 pilot questionnaire and was a telephone survey, 
conducted between September 6 and September 18, 2016 (13 days in total). 
Fieldwork was administered by the Public Governance Programme, with the 
survey administered in Cantonese and Putonghua. The total number 
of observations from the Hong Kong Study is 1,020 interviews. 

The sample is meant to be representative of registered voters, that is, 
permanent residents of Hong Kong who are aged 18 or above. Institutionalized 
persons were excluded from the sample (at most 0.3% of the total eligible 
population). The same is true for military personnel who do not have 
permanent residency in Hong Kong and therefore are not eligible to vote. 
As fixed-line telephone numbers were called for interviews, other possible 
exclusions resulted from an unknown percentage of residents without a 
fixed-line phone connection. The residential fixed-line penetration rate 
(RFLPR) was used as a proxy measurement and suggested that for every 100 
households, there were 94.5 fixed telephone lines in 2016 in Hong Kong. 
However, as some households have more than one fixed line, the number of 
households without a fixed line is unknown. The total percentage of excluded 
persons from the sample was estimated to be 5.8%.  

The study was realized as a two-stage random sample. In the first stage, 
phone numbers were selected randomly from the pool of numbers maintained by 
Collaborators. The last two digits were exchanged with random numbers to 
account for numbers not listed in the sampling frame. 
In the second stage, individual respondents were randomly selected from the 
households called. The person answering the phone call was asked how many 
registered voters lived within the household. That number was logged, and
from this, a random draw would determine one eligible person for interview.

particular age-gender category, the weight was obtained by dividing the 
share of persons in the population for that category by the share of 
respondents in the sample for that category.

The 2018 Hungarian Parliamentary election took place on Sunday, April 8, 
2018. Interviewing for the Hungarian post-election study started 15 days 
after the election, on April 23, with fieldwork lasting 13 days. The survey 
was fielded in Hungarian, using face-to-face interviewing with an electronic
questionnaire and was administered by Median Opinion and Market Research 
Institute from Budapest, Hungary. All individuals residing in Hungary who
are 18 years and older and have the right to vote were eligible respondents
for the study. Institutionalized persons were excluded from the sample. 
The total number of observations from the Hungary Study is 1,208 interviews. 

The sample for the study was created using the multi-stage randomized
procedure. In the first stage, 120 sampling units representative of the
local population were selected based on the census data of the Hungarian
Central Statistical Office (KSH). Then 20 addresses from each sampling unit
were drawn. In the final stage, at each address, interviewers only
interviewed one member of the household determined using the Leslie Kish
key. In total, 1,097 interviews were conducted using this process, although
120 interviews were excluded after audio recordings of the interviews 
were assessed, yielding 957 completed and verified respondents. 

However, the composition of the sample was heavily distorted regarding 
gender and age. The distortion of the sample was compensated in an 
additional round of data collection by determining quotas based on gender 
and age and the missing components of the study. Through this process, 251 
additional interviews were collected, yielding 1,208 participants in total.

The 2019 Indian general election was held across seven phases between 
Thursday, April 11, 2019, and Sunday, May 19, 2019. Fieldwork for the post-
election study was conducted between May 15 to May 26, 2019 (12 days in
total), by Cicero Associates & Consultants Pvt Ltd. All respondents eligible
to vote, including those participating in the election in the seventh phase
(on May 19, 2019), were interviewed after they had cast their ballot (i.e.,
all interviews were conducted post-election). The survey was administered 
face-to-face using an electronic questionnaire and in the following eleven 
languages: Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi,
Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil, and Telugu. The total number of observations 
from the India Study is 13,963 interviews.

The sample is designed to represent all eligible voters within India's 
largest 19 largest states, that is, citizens aged 18 and above who were 
registered to vote. Out of India's 543 parliamentary constituencies, 509 
are located in the 19 largest states covered in the survey. The states 
excluded from the sampling frame are part of the hill states of the 
Himalayan range or small Union Territories with five or fewer Parliamentary
Constituencies (4.0% of the total voting-eligible population).

The survey employed a multi-stage stratified random sample design. In the
first stage, 336 assembly segments were sampled from India's 19 largest 
states using the Probability Proportionate to Size (PPS) random sampling
technique. These assembly segments constituted the primary sampling unit and 
were finalized after checking demographic and political representativeness
against demographic data from India's 2011 Census and past official election
results. Within each sampled assembly segment, two polling booths were 
randomly sampled by systematic random sampling. Afterward, the latest 
electoral rolls for all 672 sampled polling stations were downloaded from
India's election commission website. From each list, 30 voters were selected
again by systematic random sampling. The sampled individual was substituted
in case of non-contact with the housing unit after two callbacks or 
refusals. For this purpose, separate lists of randomly sampled substitute
respondents within the polling station were maintained.

number of observations from the Ireland Study is 1,000 interviews.

To be eligible for inclusion in the study, respondents had to be Irish 
citizens and be at least 18 years old. Institutionalized persons were 
excluded from the sample. 
The sample was drawn in two stages. In the first stage of the sampling 
procedure, the field institute used the random digit dial (RDD) method to 
randomly select households. These respondents were interviewed in twelve 
pre-election polls leading up to the election. Half of the sample was 
interviewed using an RDD landline, the other half using an RDD mobile phone 
line. Approximately 65% of the respondents interviewed in the pre-election 
polls agreed to be re-contacted for the post-election study in which the 
CSES questionnaire was administered. This led to a sample poll of 8,000 
respondents. A random contact approach was conducted among this set of
respondents, applied to both landline and cell phones. The sample was 
stratified along quotas so that it would accurately represent the 
electorate. If necessary, to fulfill the quotas, new interviews from the 
initial RDD were conducted.

declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, although fieldwork for the 2020 study 
was conducted during the pandemic. The survey was administered by telephone 
in Hebrew and Arabic. The fieldwork was carried out by the B.I. and Lucille 
Cohen Institute for Public Opinion Research and funded by the Israeli 
Science Foundation. The total number of observations from the Israel Study 
is 1,209 interviews.

To be interviewed, a person needed to be an Israeli citizen above 18 years 
old. Institutionalized persons were excluded from the sample as sampling was 
done using the country's official household registrar, which only includes 
registered landline telephone numbers. The primary sampling units (PSU) 
were individuals in households. These PSUs were selected using random 
sampling from the national household registrar. 
The sampling was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, a random 
sample of adult citizens was compiled based on the national household 
registrar. In the second stage, this sample was matched with phone numbers. 
Only one adult in each household was interviewed. Respondents' identity was 
verified verbally using full name and surname, including middle name
when relevant. A household was designated non-sample when there was no 
answer after five callbacks or all members of the household were deemed 
ineligible.

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The 2018 Italian general election, involving elections to both the lower 
and upper house, took place on Sunday, March 4, 2018. Fieldwork for the 
study began four days later, on March 8, 2018, lasting 55 days, ending on 
May 2, 2018. All surveys were administered by Demetra Opinioni.net, using
a mixed-mode approach with respondents interviewed by telephone, cell phone,
and the Internet. The total number of observations from the Italy Study is 
2,001 interviews.

The sample is meant to be representative of the voting age population 
according to eligibility rule for the lower house elections, namely: Italian 
residents aged 18 or older. The region Valle d'Aosta/Vallee d'Aoste and 
the province Bolzano/Bozen were excluded from the sample frame because 
voters living in the region voted under different electoral rules compared 
to the rest of Italy. This resulted in the exclusion of approximately 1.5% 
of the eligible voting population.

The sample was drawn in two ways. Stage 1 involved Collaborators randomly 
drawing electoral districts within seven macro areas excluding large urban 
areas. Nine large urban areas were denoted and considered separately. 
This sampling at the first stage produced 92 clusters, 83 districts and 
9 urban areas. Stage 2 involved a random selection of districts for 
non-urban areas, while individuals were randomly sampled in the urban areas. 
Based on this sampling approach, the field institute selected respondents 
for an Internet component of the study, a landline telephone component, 
and a cell phone component. 

For the Internet component (N=501), panelists of an existing Demetra 
Opinioni.net Internet panel (total N of panel=13,734; initial recruitment by 
telephone) were randomly selected within the selected districts from the 
first sampling step as well as the nine larger cities. The chosen panelists 
were invited to participate in the study via e-mail and provided with the 
opportunity to complete the survey online. These respondents were offered a
telephone top-up voucher or Amazon voucher worth 1EUR upon completion. Of 
the approximately 800 panel respondents invited to participate, 59.6% 
(N=501) did so (3.7% of the total panel). 

For the second set of respondents (N=1,501), respondents were selected 
using a dual frame (66% list frame and 34% Random Digit Dialing) through 
random digit dialing based on the national phone book and random digit 
dialing for cell phone interviews. Respondents selected from the 
national phone book were interviewed using Computer Assisted Telephone 
Interviewing (N of completed interviews=1,000) and respondents selected by
random digit dialing for cell interviews were interviewed using Computer- 
Assisted Mobile Interviewing (N of completed interviews=500). Respondents 
chosen for the mobile phone interviews were asked at the beginning of the 
interview about the city and neighborhood they resided in. If they did not
live in a city or district sampled in the first stage, the interviews were
canceled, and the respondents were flagged as ineligible. In total, the 
two-stage sampling procedure resulted in approximately 20 interviews per 
electoral district (range: 14 to 26 interviews) except for Milan (73 
interviews), Naples (38 interviews), Rome (102 interviews) and Turin (47 
interviews), where more respondents were interviewed.

The 2018 Italy Study provides a SAMPLE WEIGHT, a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT, and 
a POLITICAL WEIGHT, each of which was created for the whole sample. The 
sample weight (E1010_1) adjusts the sample to correct for the different 
selection probabilities of clusters (i.e., constituencies and large cities) 
within different macro-areas as well as for the different probabilities of 
selection of individuals within clusters. 
The demographic weight (E1010_2) adjusts the sample to match known 
demographic characteristics, namely gender (male, female), age group 
(18-44, 45-59, 60+), geographical area (north, center, south), and 
education (low, middle, high). The political weight (E1010_3) adjusts the 
sample to the population frequencies by vote shares of the major coalitions 
and parties (center-right and center-left) in the lower house election and  
abstainers at the regional level. 
Because the voting age differs between the lower house (18 years and older) 
and the upper house (25 years and older), users should be aware that 
applying any of the three weights when analyzing upper-house elections may
result in non-representative results.

The 2017 Japanese general election was held on Sunday, October 22, 2017.
Fieldwork for the Japanese study began on January 12, 2018 and was completed
on March 13, 2018 (61 days in total). The survey was administered by The 
Central Research Services, Inc. The study employed a mixed-mode approach. 
Most data were collected face-to-face, using a paper questionnaire. 
Respondents not reached in person were sent a copy of the questionnaire to
self-complete and mail-back. Surveys were administered in Japanese.
Respondents were adult citizens (18 years old and older) who held Japanese 
citizenship and were registered voters for the 2017 general election. 
The total number of observations from the Japan Study is 1,688 interviews.

The sample for the Japanese study was drawn randomly in a stratified 
multi-stage procedure. Electoral district's "chiten" (comparable to 
precincts in the US) were the primary sampling unit, stratified by region
(eleven categories) and city size based on the following five categories:
21 big cities, cities with a population of more than 200,000, cities with 
more than 100,000 inhabitants, other smaller cities, and towns or villages.
This resulted in an 11 x 5 table with 55 cells. The number of chitens 
(220 in total) was assigned to each cell proportionally to the size of the 
population. Within the 220 chiten, 3,000 individuals were randomly selected
from municipalities' electoral registers. These voter registration lists 
provide names, gender, and age of the sampled individual, allowing 
interviewers to assess respondents' identities before the interview. 
After their participation, respondents received a voucher worth 1,000 JPY
(roughly 10 USD).

The 2017 Japan Study provides a COMBINED SAMPLE and DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT 
and a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT.
The combined weight (E1010_1) corrects for variations in response rates 
between geographic regions and demographic characteristics, while the
demographic weight (E1010_2) only corrects for demographic characteristics.
The combined weight was constructed using the categories of gender by age by
location. The age variable was grouped into five categories, and the
location was grouped into six categories to avoid using 11 locations and
small weighting cells, given that the Japanese sample includes only 1,688 
respondents in total. The demographic weight was constructed using gender 
by age, with age being grouped into five categories.

<<>> STUDY DESIGN    

The 2018 Latvian parliamentary elections were held on Saturday, October 6,
2018. Fieldwork for the study began 39 days after the elections and was 
conducted between November 14, 2018, and December 1, 2018 (18 days in 
total). The fieldwork was carried out by TNS Latvia. The survey was 
administered in Latvian and Russian via face-to-face interviews using an 
electronic questionnaire. The total number of observations from the Latvia 
Study is 1,011 interviews.

The sample is meant to be representative of Latvian citizens aged 18-75 
years old at the time of the election. The study employed a stratified 
four-stage quasi-random probability approach. The size of each geographic 
region determines proportionally the number of sampling points to be 
allocated for each stratum. In total, there were four stages of sampling: 
1) selection of sampling points; 2) selection of addresses; 3) selection of 
households; and 4) selection of respondents. 

The selection of sampling points comes from a list of Latvia's populated
points with the number of citizens designating size. These are sorted by 
region, district and urbanization level to ensure appropriate representation
of regional and urban populations. The planned number of sample points is 
calculated based on the assumption of 10 interviews per sample point. A 
random number procedure determines the starting point in the list of cities 
or parishes from which the selection of addresses/households starts. 
Households are selected according to the route instructions - each second 
dwelling in apartment buildings, each second home in an area of individual 
houses; ascending or descending sequence varies depending on odd and even 
sizes of the streets. In the last stage, individuals were selected granting
precedence to the youngest male in the household. At each address, the
interviewer clarified who of the present household members was the youngest
man. If no male was present during the visit, the youngest woman in the 
household was selected for the interview. If selected persons refused to 
participate or could not be contacted after two visits, the household was
dropped from the sample.

The first round of Parliamentary elections in Lithuania was held on Sunday,
October 9, 2016. In constituencies where no candidate won the required 
majority, the second round of elections was held on Sunday, October 23, 
2016. Interviewing for the Lithuanian post-election study started 33 days 
after the first round on November 11, 2016, running for thirty days.  
Baltic Surveys Ltd from Vilnius, Lithuania, conducted the fieldwork. 
The survey was administered in Lithuanian, using face-to-face interviews 
with a paper questionnaire. The study is meant to be representative of
all citizens of Lithuania aged 18 years or older who are registered to 
vote, with only homeless people being excluded from the sample frame.
The total number of observations from the Lithuania Study is 1,500 
interviews.

The sample for the study was created using multi-stage stratified 
proportional sampling. In the first stage, based on the Nomenclature of
Territorial Units as used in the official EU statistics, the Republic of
Lithuania was divided into ten administrative units (counties). Then, the
total number of interviews in each survey region (county) was allocated to
six strata in proportion to the population of each stratum. The stratum is
defined by settlement size. In the third stage, primary sampling units 
were randomly selected from each stratum (county and settlement size 
combination cell) list. After that, households were selected using the
random route from the starting point, and respondents within households 
were selected by using the "last birthday rule" among all household members 
aged 18 years and older.

The first round of Lithuania's Parliamentary elections were held on Sunday,
October 11, 2020. In constituencies where no candidate won the required 
majority, the second round of elections was held on Sunday, October 25, 
2020. The election and the fieldwork for the study took place during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Fieldwork for the Lithuanian study started on January 21,
2021, 102 days after the first round (88 days after round 2) and was 
completed on February 21, 2021 (32 days in total). UAB Norstat LT was 
responsible for fieldwork, and the survey was administered in Lithuanian. 
The study is meant to be representative of all Lithuanian citizens aged 18
years or older registered to vote. The total number of observations from 
the Lithuania Study is 1,781 interviews.

Respondents were interviewed via the Internet due to COVID-19 pandemic 
restrictions. The sample was recruited via telephone using random digit 
dialing (dual-frame with 10% landline and 90% cell phone numbers). Hence, 
telephone numbers were the primary sampling unit. However, respondents 
without telephone access were excluded from the sampling frame. 
All phone numbers used for recruiting interviewees were randomly generated 
as follows: All numbers started with "8" as the first digit, the general 
code for dialing within Lithuania. In a second step, city or mobile dialing
codes were added randomly. The remaining five or six digits were selected
randomly as well, resulting in a final nine-digit number. In total, 120,000 
randomly generated numbers were uploaded into the calling systems and used 
for the survey. Depending on whether interviewers worked from the office or 
remotely, two different calling systems were used.

After a short telephone screening interview assessing eligibility, 
respondents were invited to participate in the online survey upon providing 
their mobile phone number or email address. If interviewees refused to 
participate via the Internet, they were invited to answer a selected subset 
of the questionnaire via telephone. However, as only a subset of CSES
survey questions were asked with this approach, the 47 respondents who 
participated in this way are not included in the CSES.

The 2020 Lithuania Study provides a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT and a COMBINED 
DEMOGRAPHIC and POLITICAL WEIGHT. Both weights were constructed using the 
function "rake()" available in the R-package "survey". The demographic 
weight corrects distributions in the sample to known socio-demographic 
population characteristics (gender, age, education, and settlement size) 
based on the Lithuanian official statistics portal. 
The political weight builds upon the demographic weight, additionally 
adjusting the sample according to district candidate votes in the first 
round of the 2020 Lithuanian parliamentary election, based on numbers 
provided by Lithuania's Central Electoral Commission. 
Due to sample imbalances, some of the weights were unusual in size. 
Therefore, both weights were trimmed to range between 0.2 and 5 using the
function "trimWeights()" available in the R-package "survey". In total, 
weights for 12 respondents were trimmed for the demographic and 133 for the 
combined weight (0.7% and 7.5% of the sample, respectively).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The 2018 Mexican general elections took place on Sunday, July 1, 2018. The 
Mexican study featured a pre and post-election panel design in which 
respondents were interviewed four times: twice before the general election 
and twice after. The CSES sample comprises the third wave of interviews, 
with 47.7% of respondents from the first pre-election wave completing the
the third wave and thus answering the CSES survey. The total number of 
observations from the Mexico Study is 1,239 interviews. 

Post-election interviewing featuring the CSES survey started on July 12, 
2018 and was completed on July 18, 2018 (7 days in total). Ipsos Mexico 
conducted the fieldwork, administering the survey face-to-face using an 
electronic questionnaire and in Spanish. The study is meant to be 
representative of the national population aged 18 years or older, excluding 
those who were institutionalized at the time of the survey (approx. 0.06% 
of the total eligible population).

The study was realized as a stratified multi-stage random cluster sample. 
In the first stage, the universe was divided into three regions: states 
with a governor by the National Action Party (PAN), states with a governor
by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), and states with a governor
by the Party of Democratic Revolution (PRD). An independent sample was drawn
for each region. Within each region, precincts were clustered by county
(municipalities), where clusters were divided into four equally sized groups
ordered by the vote for PRI in the last election. These resulting clusters
served as the primary sampling unit (PSU), where precincts within each 
group were clustered with probability proportional to size (PPS).
In a subsequent stage, precincts were selected with PPS. The sampled 
precincts were then passed on to the fieldwork teams, who randomly selected
blocs within each respective precinct area. In each block, houses were 
selected following systematic methods of random start. At the last stage, 
respondents within households were chosen with the last-birthday method. 
In case the selected person was not available for an interview at the time,
replacements with another eligible household member with the second to last
birthday were permissible. If none of the selected household members could
be interviewed after two visits, interviewers moved on to the next household
to the right.

Respondents received an incentive of 150 MXN (approximately 7 USD) if they
participated in the second and third waves of the panel survey. Incentives
were paid after each wave (waves 2 and 3). All respondents received the same
incentives, even the reluctant respondents.

with a post-stratification weight for gender and age distributions
from the 2015 Mexican census.

The 2016 Montenegrin Parliamentary elections were held on Sunday, October 
16, 2016. The post-election cross-sectional study was fielded between 
December 8, 2016, and January 16, 2017 (40 days in total). The fieldwork 
was conducted by De Facto Consultancy based in Podgorica, with surveys 
administered face-to-face using an electronic questionnaire and in 
Montenegrin. The sample is meant to be representative of eligible 
Montenegrin citizens aged 18 years or older and registered to vote. 
Institutionalized persons (people in prison or hospitals) were excluded 
from the sample (less than 1 percent of the eligible population). The total 
number of observations from the Montenegro Study is 1,213 interviews.

The sampling was conceptualized as a stratified multi-stage random sample 
with three stages in total. In the first stage, the population was divided 
into three regions, North, Center and South. These regions were the primary 
sampling unit and chosen based on differences in population size, the 
distribution of ethnic groups within a region, age groups, and the region's 
geography, economy, and history. 
Second, inside each regional stratum, polling stations were identified, 
which constitute the smallest municipal unit and are at the same time a 
unit for voting. These polling stations formed the second level of 
stratification and were divided into three groups according to their size. 
Polling stations were selected randomly from each group. 
In the third and final stage, a random procedure based on 'step-and-go' was 
employed inside polling stations to choose the household. The last person 
to have had their birthday within the household was interviewed.

The 2017 Dutch general election was held on Wednesday, March 15, 2017. 
The Dutch study was fielded between March 16, 2017, and July 4, 2017 (111
days in total). The study featured a mixed-mode design combining 
face-to-face interviews using an electronic questionnaire with a self-
completion mail-back component, and a separate sample interviewed via the 
Internet drawn from an online panel, where respondents were administered 
the survey in a series of different interview blocks. Interviews were 
conducted in Dutch. Kantar Public administered the face-to-face and self-
completion mail-back component of the study, while CentERdata were 
responsible for the Internet (online panel) component. The total number of 
observations from the Netherlands Study is 1,903 interviews: 723 from the
face-to-face/self-completion component and 1,180 from the Internet 
component. 

For both sampling components, questions were split between the main post-
election interview and a supplementary questionnaire, the latter of which 
contained most CSES survey items. The CSES sample only includes respondents
who completed both questionnaires. Samples were drawn independently for 
face-to-face and Internet interviews. Both samples aim to represent eligible
voters - i.e., Dutch citizens aged 18 years or older.

The face-to-face/self-completion component was realized as a probability 
sample provided by Statistics Netherlands (CBS) with population registers 
as the sampling frame. Sampling occurred in two steps: First, a sample of 
municipalities was drawn, excluding only the small, Northern islands, 
followed by a sample of individuals within those municipalities. 
Interviewers visited respondents at home, reading the questions and entering
their answers on a tablet. After completing the questionnaire, interviewers
left a self-completion paper questionnaire with the respondent. Respondents
were asked to complete this questionnaire at their convenience and return it
by mail. In a final attempt to increase response rates at a late fieldwork
stage, a small number of respondents were provided with a link to complete
the supplementary questionnaire online. Eight respondents in the sample made 
use of this opportunity. 
Respondents were initially offered 15 EUR for participation in the survey, 
with the option to donate it to charity. This amount was escalated to a 
maximum of 50 EUR in subsequent rounds of refusal conversion.

The online sample component was drawn randomly from the ongoing "LISS panel"
(Langlopende Internet Studies voor de Sociale Wetenschappen). Members of the
LISS panel participate in regular online surveys over an extended time 
period. To reach people without a computer or Internet access, LISS provides
the option to lend an easy-to-use computer with free Internet access. 
Managed by the research agency CentERdata, the LISS panel was launched in 
2007. To maintain the representativeness of the panel, respondents who 
dropped out are replaced by new participants with similar registered 
characteristics. Overall, the panel was refreshed in four subsequent waves
in 2009, 2011-2012, 2013-2014 and 2016-2017. All four refreshment samples 
were based on probability sampling from register data. Further, all but the 
2011-2012 refreshment wave over-sampled difficult-to-reach groups with a 
below-average response in the main recruitment - stratified by household 
type, age, and ethnicity. 
LISS panel respondents were incentivized relative to the length of the 
questionnaire and paid about 5 EUR for filling in a 20-minute questionnaire. 
For this purpose, the questionnaire was broken up into three parts of 
roughly 20 minutes each. Upon completing the main questionnaire, respondents
from the LISS panel were invited to fill in the supplementary questionnaire
as a second online form.

Survey data from both face-to-face and Internet interviews were supplemented 
with data from population registers for a selected list of demographic 
variables, namely marital status, household income, region of residence and 
country of origin. Respondents provided consent before data collection.   
Generally, register data is based on the most recently available data, 
usually the year preceding data collection.

The political weight (E1010_3) builds upon the demographic weight and 
additionally adjusts the sample according to vote choice (party vote shares
and abstention).
Weights were calculated step-wise based on the univariate distribution of 
every characteristic. For every category of the first characteristic, the 
count in the population was first divided by the count in the survey. 
Subsequently, every respondent was assigned a weight reflecting the ratio 
of their category. The sample distribution of the second characteristic was 
calculated after applying weights for the first characteristic. This 
procedure was repeated for every other characteristic. 
All individual weights were then multiplied to obtain a single combined 
weight variable for all characteristics together. In the final step, this 
variable was divided by its mean such that all weights have an average of 1.

The 2021 Dutch general election was held on Wednesday, March 17, 2021, 
(with additional voting taking place March 15-16, 2021). The election and 
the fieldwork for the study took place during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The Dutch study was fielded between March 17, 2021 and May 17, 2021 (61 days
in total). The study had a panel design with two distinct and independent 
sampling components: 1) A fresh random register sample and 2) a sample drawn 
from the "LISS" online panel (Langlopende Internet Studies voor de Sociale 
Wetenschappen). All respondents were invited to be interviewed both before
and after the election, with respondents in both components interviewed at
least twice. 

The study featured a mixed-mode design. All respondents to the LISS Panel 
component were interviewed via the Internet. Respondents from the register 
sample could choose to participate via Internet or a self-completion mail-
back questionnaire. In a few instances, Collaborators received two completed
questionnaires for the register sample: one on paper and one digitally. In
those cases, the questionnaire in which most questions were answered was 
included. In case of a tie, the dataset includes the interview that was 
completed first. Interviews were conducted in Dutch. I&O Research 
administered the register sample (Internet & Self-Completion), while 
CentERdata were responsible for the Internet (online panel) component. 
The total number of observations from the Netherlands Study is 3,485 
interviews: 1,797 from the LISS Panel and 1,688 from the register sample. 

The register sample completed the CSES survey without interruption. 
Respondents to the LISS Panel had the CSES survey split into two components. 
Given that most of the demographic questions and some CSES survey level 
questions were elicited in pre-election interviews, in addition to CSES 
survey questions being spread evenly across both waves of the LISS 
post-election interview, only respondents who participated in all interview 
rounds appear in the data. 

The fresh 2021 sample is meant to be representative of eligible voters in 
the Dutch 2021 parliamentary election, that is, registered Dutch citizens 
aged 18 years on election day or older. Institutionalized persons were 
excluded from the sampling frame (less than one percent of the voting 
eligible population), as were Dutch nationals living abroad. 
The sample was realized as a two-stage stratified cluster sample provided
by Statistics Netherlands (CBS), with population registers as the sampling 
frame. Sampling occurred in two steps: First, a stratified sample of 
municipalities was drawn with probability proportional to population size,
followed by a simple random sample of persons within those municipalities.
Hence, individuals were the primary sampling unit. Sampled interviewees were
invited to an online survey via mail but provided with the option to 
complete paper-assisted self-interviews. After one week, respondents not 
having participated yet received a reminder together with the paper 
questionnaire. Respondents were initially offered 5 EUR for participation
in the pre- and post-election survey each. This amount was increased to a
maximum of 15 EUR per interview in subsequent rounds of refusal conversion.
In the final contact approach of the post-election wave, incentives were 
raised to 25 EUR. Additionally, respondents could participate in a lottery
with a chance of winning 400 EUR in the form of a tablet, a gift card or a
donation to a charity. This incentive was used both for the pre- and the 
post-wave.

The second sample component interviewed entirely online was drawn randomly 
from the ongoing LISS panel, based on panel members eligible to vote in the
2021 election. Panelists participate in regular online surveys over an 
extended period. To reach people without a computer or Internet access,
LISS provides the option to lend an easy-to-use computer with free Internet
access. Managed by the research agency Centerdata, the LISS panel was 
launched in 2007. To maintain the representativeness of the panel, 
respondents who dropped out are replaced by new participants with similar
registered characteristics. Overall, the panel was refreshed in five
subsequent waves in 2009, 2011-2012, 2013-2014, 2016-2017 and 2019-2020. 
All five refreshment samples were based on probability sampling from 
register data. Further, all but the 2011-2012 refreshment wave oversampled
difficult-to-reach groups with a below-average response in the main 
recruitment - stratified by household type, age, and ethnicity. 
LISS panelists are incentivized relative to the length of the questionnaire.
As the questionnaire was split into three parts of equal size, respondents
received 7.50 EUR per wave, amounting to 22.50 EUR.

The 2017 New Zealand Parliamentary election was held on Saturday, September 
23, 2017. Fieldwork for the post-election study, part of the New Zealand
Election Study (NZES), was conducted between September 26, 2017 and February 
28, 2018 (156 days in total) and the survey was administered by COMPASS 
(Centre of Methods and Policy Applications in the Social Sciences) at the 
University of Auckland. The survey was administered in English, and the  
study employed a mixed-mode approach, with respondents having the choice to 
participate via the Internet or via self-completion mail-back. Hence, 
respondents could self-select into interview modes. The total number of 
observations from the New Zealand Study is 1,808 interviews: 1,558 via 
self-completion mail-back and 250 via the Internet. While the NZES had 
a panel component, only respondents joining the sample afresh in 2017 are 
included in the CSES. 

The sample consists of all eligible citizens that registered on the 
electoral roll on the writ day, then aged between 18 and older. On the writ 
day, the electoral roll contained about 88% of those eligible. 
Enrollment continued after writ day until the day before the election, 
with the final roll including just over 92% of the eligible population.
Those in prison were excluded from the sample, but as they are not eligible
to enroll or vote, this does not influence the sampling frame. Military 
personnel was included in the sample. 

The survey employed a random sampling procedure based on the electoral 
rolls as of August 23, 2017. The electoral roll was split into four groups 
to determine sampling units, namely: 
- electors aged 18-30. 
- electors aged 31 and over.
- electors in Maori electorates aged 18-30.  
- electors in Maori electorates aged 31 and over

Young voters and those residing in Maori electorates were deliberately
oversampled as they are known to have a lower likelihood of responding to
surveys. The sample design included clustering and quota sampling in the 
sense that it was sampled within the four segments. The survey used a 
draw for four small monetary prizes as participation incentives.

The 2020 New Zealand Parliamentary election was held on Saturday, October 
17, 2020. The election and the fieldwork for the study took place during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Fieldwork for the post-election study, part of the New 
Zealand Election Study (NZES), was conducted between October 21, 2020 and 
May 1, 2021 (192 days in total) and the survey was administered by the 
Public Policy Institute at the University of Auckland. The survey was 
administered in English, Chinese, and Maori, and the study employed a 
mixed-mode approach, with respondents having the choice to participate via 
the Internet or via self-completion mail-back. Hence, respondents could 
self-select into interview modes. The total number of observations from the
New Zealand Study is 1,725 interviews: 999 via self-completion mail-back and
726 via the Internet. 

A person needed to be registered and above 18 years old to be interviewed. 
The sample did not include institutionalized persons who were ineligible to 
vote and people on the confidential roll (about 1% of the eligible 
population).
The survey employed a random sampling procedure based on the computerized 
electoral rolls. The primary sampling units were individuals nested within 
Maori descent and age. Maori descent and individuals between 18 and 29 were 
over-sampled to adjust for lower response rates. In a further stage of 
selection, the Maori sub-sample was randomly resampled to correspond to the 
percentage on the electoral roll. The sample design thus included 
clustering and stratification by Maori descent and age. Respondents 
received a 20 NZD grocery voucher for their survey participation. For 90% 
of the completed surveys, survey verification checked whether the reported 
age and gender correctly matched.

The 2017 Norwegian Parliamentary election took place on Monday, September 
11, 2017. The study is a post-election survey, and in a change to previous 
practice, was conducted as a standalone study to the Norwegian National 
Election Study. The study was fielded between September 20, 2017, and 
October 16, 2017 (36 days in total). Statistics Norway handled the fieldwork 
with interviews via the Internet. The total number of observations from the 
Norway Study is 1,792 interviews.

The sampling frame for the study is a two-stage design. In the first stage,
the country was divided into 363 primary sampling units (PSUs) based on
the local municipalities. All PSUs with more than 30,000 inhabitants and
some with a population number between 25,000 and 30,000 constitute
separate strata. For the remaining PSUs, strata were formed as
homogeneously as possible. In the second stage of the sampling, survey 
units (individuals) were drawn from the population register, selected from 
the 109 sampling areas, using systematic random sampling. The sampling 
fraction in the second stage is proportional to the inverse selection 
probability in the first stage. The final sample then is self-weighting 
when both stages are taken into consideration. If a sampled unit from the 
panel sample had moved out of their original PSU, it was still included in 
the sample.

The sample is meant to be representative of Norwegian citizens aged between 
18 and 91. Norwegians without Internet access were excluded from the 
sampling frame (estimated to be 2% of the eligible population). The sample 
consisted of 5,000 people over the age of 18 drawn randomly from the 
National registry covering all Norwegian inhabitants. As they sampled 
individuals and not households, more than one person could have been 
interviewed from a single household. Potential respondents received both an 
e-mail and a text message for participation. Both contained a weblink which, 
when activated, guided respondents to the survey. Additional reminders were 
sent to those who did not participate in the survey after the initial 
contact. The respondents did not receive any incentives for their 
participation in the study.

The 2017 Norway Study provides a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT. The weight was 
constructed after Collaborators found over- and under-representation in the
survey were related to particular demographic characteristics. Respondents
with higher education were over-represented compared to those with lower 
education. Those in the age group 45-66 years were over-represented as well,
whilst the oldest in the sample were underrepresented. 

The weight adjusts for gender, age, and education, dividing the sample into
18 different strata. Gender contained two categories: male and female. Age
was divided into three categories: 30 years or under, 31 to 59 years, and
60 years and over. Education was also divided into three categories: first
no education/ primary school or unspecified, second high school, and third
university/ college. The stratified weight is set then as equal to the
number of persons in the strata in the population divided by the number of
persons in the strata in the net sample.

2021, and January 7, 2022 (17 days in total). The survey was administered 
face-to-face using an electronic questionnaire. The survey was administered 
in Spanish, with fieldwork carried out by Ipsos Group S.A. The total number 
of observations from the Peru Study is 1,199 interviews.

A person needed to be registered and above 18 years old to be interviewed. 
The sample did not include institutionalized persons who were not eligible 
to vote, about 0.3% of the eligible population.
The survey employed a stratified multi-stage sampling where the primary 
sampling units were the localities of the country. The localities were
selected using a systematic random selection proportional to the number of
inhabitants of each locality. In the second stage of selection, the zones
were selected. A zone is a subdivision of the district defined by the 
National Institute of Statistics (INEI) and corresponds to about 40 blocks.
In the third stage, households were selected and in the last one, 
individuals. Whilst sampling units in the first three stages were randomly 
selected, individuals in the last stage were selected by quotas of sex and
age. Clustering was included in the first stage using localities.
Stratification was used for selecting geographical regions in the country.
For all completed surveys, respondents' identities were verified in real-

December 15, 2019 (65 days in total), with interviewing face-to-face using
an electronic questionnaire. Fieldwork was conducted by GfK Portugal, with
questionnaires administered in Portuguese. The total number of observations 
from the Portugal Study is 1,500 interviews.

The sample is meant to be representative of individuals aged 18 years or
older residing in continental Portugal. Portuguese citizenship was not 
required to participate in the interview. The two autonomous regions Madeira
and the Azores were excluded from the sample frame (5 percent of the 
eligible population). The same holds for institutionalized persons (less 
than 1 percent of the eligible population).

The study is based on a multi-stage stratified random sample. The sample was
stratified according to locality size ("habitat") and EU NUTS II regions; a 
hierarchical geocode standard subdividing the territories of EU member 
states. The NUTS II regions North, Centre, Lisbon, Alentejo, and Algarve 
were also the primary sampling unit. In the first step, the random selection
of localities within each of the five listed NUTS II regions was carried out
following the General Index of INE's Population Census, based on the sample
matrix of NUTS II regions and habitat. In each designated locality, sample
points were then again sampled randomly. Afterward, households were selected
through random route. From within each household, the adult who had the most
recent birthday was selected for the interview in the last step. If the 
selected person was not available, up to three more revisits were made to 
reach the potential interviewee on different days (week and weekend) and 
throughout different times of the day. After a fourth unsuccessful visit, 
the selected individual was replaced by another person with similar 
characteristics (sex, age group and location) from a different household.

Romanian via face-to-face using an electronic questionnaire. The fieldwork 
was conducted by the CCSAS from Cluj-Napoca, Romania. The total number of 
observations from the Romania Study is 1,105 interviews.

The sample is meant to be representative of Romanian citizens aged 18 years
or older at the time of the election, but it excluded institutionalized 
citizens (estimated to be 0.25% of the Romanian population). The sample was 
designed by stratified two-stage probability sampling, with stratification 
of the primary units (voting districts, namely areas comprising a number of 
streets allocated to a polling station) proportional to the number of 
secondary units (adults registered in the electoral register). In the second 
stage, 10 respondents were selected by systematic sampling with equal 
probabilities from the electoral register of each voting district selected 
(the main sample). A reserve sample of 10 respondents was chosen to 
compensate for refusals.

The 2016 Romania Study provides a SAMPLE WEIGHT, a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT and a
POLITICAL WEIGHT.
The sample weight (E1010_1) is designed to correct for the variations in
the probability of selection in the sample (as voting polls differ in size).
The demographic weight (E1010_2) was computed after including the sample
weight. It is designed to match known demographic characteristics of the
population (according to the last available Census, from 2011). Demographic
weight was computed by dividing the population structure to the sample
structure. The structure was defined by the joint distribution of several
variables: Gender (male/female), age categories (18-34, 35-49, 50-64, 65+),
residence (urban/rural), and region (8 categories).
The political weight (E1010_3) was computed after including the demographic
weight, thus also consequently including the sample weight. It is designed
to correct the sample to match the official (Central Electoral Bureau) 
election results at the national level for both Parliament houses
simultaneously.

The 2020 Slovakian Parliamentary elections were held on Saturday, February
29, 2020. The election took place just before the COVID-19 pandemic was 
declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, although fieldwork for the 2020 study 
was conducted during the pandemic. Fieldwork began on June 9, 2020, after
a wait of three months for the government to lift COVID-19 pandemic 
restrictions which made face-to-face interviewing impossible. Fieldwork 
lasted 84 days, was completed on August 31, 2020, and was administered by
Kantar Slovakia. Data were collected via face-to-face interviewing using 
an electronic questionnaire. The survey was administered in Slovakian. The 
total number of observations from the Slovakia Study is 1,003 interviews.

The sample is meant to be representative of Slovakian citizens aged 18
years or older on election day. Up to 3% of citizens (homeless, imprisoned, 
persons living in retirement homes) were excluded from the sample frame.
The Slovakian study sample was created by random sampling from the
register of all communities (villages and towns) in Slovakia based on the
proportions of the population of age 18+ and the size of the community.
In total, 143 territory sampling units were selected. Households in these
units were chosen by a random walk (according to strict rules). Further,
respondents in the household were selected following the closest birthday
method. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, the interviewing took
longer than envisaged, and some PSUs were hard to reach. Because of that,
interviewers could not cover approximately 20% of the PSUs selected in the
original sample. To compensate for this, the Slovakian team agreed they
would do another wave of sampling to collect the missing approximately 33%
of the sample. In the end, 668 respondents answered the survey from the
first round of fieldwork where 20% of PSUs were not visited, and 335
respondents answered the survey in the second round of fieldwork.

until April 20, 2016, and was administered by the Korean Social Science Data 
Center. Interviews were conducted face-to-face using a paper questionnaire 
and were administered in Korean. The total number of observations from the 
South Korea Study is 1,199 interviews. 

The sample is meant to be representative of registered South Korean voters 
aged 19 and above. People living on Cheju Island and other small islands 
were excluded from the sample frame. This is common for Korean national 
surveys, as people living in these regions are difficult to contact and 
make up less than one percent of the population. 

The sample was realized as a multi-stage random sample, for which electoral 
districts represented the primary sampling units. In the first stage, 80 
electoral districts were randomly sampled from a list of all electoral
districts in South Korea. In the second stage, voting districts within each
sampled electoral district were randomly sampled. In the third and final 
stage, a simple random sample of voters was drawn within each voting 
district, based on electoral registers provided by the Central Election 
Management Committee. When contacting a respondent's household, 
interviewers asked for the name of the respondent and identified her or

fielded between September 10 and November 6, 2018 (a total of 58 days) by 
Statistics Sweden (SCB). Due to an administrative lapse, this study fielded
the CSES MODULE 5 pilot questionnaire and employed a mixed-mode approach 
with respondents initially contacted via mail and offered the choice of

completion mail-back and 887 via the Internet. 

The sample was conceptualized as a simple random sample and is meant to be 
representative of Swedish citizens living in Sweden who were entitled to 
vote and between 18 and 80 years old. Eligible Swedish citizens living 
abroad were excluded from the sample frame (about 2% of the population). 
Individuals were sampled directly from population registers provided by 
Statistics Sweden and were hence the primary sampling unit. To encourage
participation, sampled respondents were sent letters to inform them about 
the study's purpose and offered a gift card worth 50 SEK.

The 2018 Sweden Study provides a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT. Weights were calculated
using an iterative proportional fitting algorithm (raking).
The demographic weight (E1010_2) adjusts the data to match known demographic
characteristics, namely gender (male, female), age groups (18-25, 26-40,
41-64, 65-80), and education (seven categories based on the Swedish
education classification scheme "Svensk utbildningsnomenklatur (SUN)").
In general, Collaborators used public register data on respondents to
calculate the demographic weight, with the following exceptions:
For age groups, no public records data were available for one respondent, 
and the survey information was used instead.
For education, public records data were unavailable for 857 respondents,
due to the respondents not approving of the use of public records data.
For these 857 individuals, Collaborators imputed data based on sex and age
groups. Collaborators note they chose to make imputations based on census
data even though survey data was available because they found an
unexpectedly low correlation between survey responses and census register
data on education in previous analyses. Particularly older age groups tend
to overestimate their formal level of education. To get a cleaner measure,
Collaborators hence decided against mixing survey responses with census
data.

administered by FORS - the Swiss Centre for Expertise in the Social 
Sciences. The total number of observations from the Switzerland Study is 
4,645 interviews. 

The study employed a mixed-mode approach with interviews collected via the 
Internet and mail-back self-completion. All selected respondents were first 
invited to complete the survey via the Internet. With the second reminder 
(out of three), a paper version of the questionnaire was sent to those who 
had not yet participated in the survey. Hence, all respondents who completed
the survey after the reception of the second reminder self-selected into 
the mode of interview. The survey was administered in German, French and 
Italian. The sample was designed to be representative of all Swiss citizens
residing in Switzerland who were at least 18 years old on Election Day 
(October 20, 2019) and thus eligible to vote. Only Swiss citizens living 
abroad were not included in the sample - 3.4% of all registered voters.

The sample was drawn by the Federal Statistical Office (FSO) from their
sampling frame of Swiss citizens who were at least 18 years old and
residing in Switzerland at the time of the elections, with individuals as
primary sampling units. The total number of individuals in the sample was
17,866. The sample size was adjusted to have a minimum of at least 80
respondents per canton in each of the 26 cantons (oversampling of small
cantons). Additionally, the cantons of Ticino, Geneva and Zurich are
traditionally over-sampled in the Swiss Election Study in order to have a
larger N for the three main language regions (Italian-speaking,
French-speaking and German-speaking, respectively).

The 2019 Switzerland Study provides a SAMPLE WEIGHT and a COMBINED SAMPLE
and POLITICAL WEIGHT.
The Sample Weight (E1010_1) corrects for the oversampling of small cantons  
and two larger cantons (Ticino and Zurich). This weight was calculated as 
the quotient of the proportion of eligible voters in the population of each
canton and the proportion of respondents in the sample that falls within
the canton.
The Political Weight (E1010_3) corrects biases that result from
oversampling, turnout, and party choice in the data. The weight is
calculated by multiplying three weights, namely the Design, Turnout and
Party Choice Weights. The turnout and party choice biases in survey data
are common phenomena in Switzerland.

The sample is meant to be representative of all qualified voters in Taiwan.
These are all Taiwanese citizens who are 20 years or older. The survey used 
a probability proportional to size (PPS) three-stage systematic sampling. 
In the first stage, legislative constituencies were sampled according to
major geographic regions. In the second stage, urban villages or rural
villages were selected as sampling units. In the third stage, respondents

To be interviewed, a person needed to be a Taiwanese citizen aged at least
20 years old. Institutionalized persons (estimated to be 0.04% of the 
population) were excluded from the sample as felons are ineligible to vote 
in Taiwan. In the first stage of sampling, legislative constituencies were 
sampled according to major geographic regions. In the second stage, urban 
villages or rural villages were selected as sampling units. In the third 
stage, samples were selected from address-based sampling of a geographical
information system (GIS). The final stage was implemented via in-house 
sampling that included two steps. First, the interviewer asked, "How many 
adults who are over 20 years old and whose household registration is at this 
address (regardless of whether they live here or not)?" Second, "among these 
adults, [computer sampling results] is the person we wanted to interview."
To increase the response rate, a notification letter for the interview was

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The 2019 Thai general election was held on Sunday, March 24, 2019. 
The Thai 2019 study was conceptualized as a post-election survey conducted
between April 25 and June 5, 2019 (42 days in total). Fieldwork was 
administered by the King Prajadhipok's Institute. Interviews were conducted
in local Thai dialects and Tribe languages and face-to-face using a paper 
questionnaire.

The multi-stage systematic random sample is meant to represent Thailand's 
eligible voting population (i.e., Thai citizens aged 18 years or above and 
registered to vote).
For this survey, the country was divided into five regions corresponding to
the four regions of Thailand plus the special administrative area of 
Bangkok. Within each of the four regions, a list of Amphoe (districts) per 
region was randomly selected (stage 1), with these districts serving as the
primary sampling units. In stage 2, Tambol (subdistricts)were randomly 
selected within each Amphoe. Afterward, a specified number of villages 
(Muban) were sampled within each Tambol (stage 3). Stage 4 determined the 
number of people to be surveyed within a village. 

In each stage, the number of units for sampling within a geographic area 
was chosen proportionally to population size. Individual respondents were 
systematically sampled from lists provided by the Community Department of 
the Ministry of Interior. In Bangkok, a list of sub-districts was randomly 
selected in stage 1 in proportion to population size. Subsequently, 
systematic sampling was applied to select individual respondents from 
electoral registers. After the interview, respondents received a notebook 
and a pen to thank them for their participation. 

Researchers are advised that substitution of individuals was permissible at
the final stage of selection in all five regions. The substitution process
was coordinated by Collaborators and applied in cases where interviewers 
could not contact the sampled person due to relocation, decease, illnesses 
etc. Substituted individuals were sampled in the same manner as regular 
respondents, matching the age and gender of the originally sampled person.
The total number of observations from the Thailand Study is 1,536 
interviews, of which 370 have been conducted with substituted persons.

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The 2019 Tunisian parliamentary election took place on Sunday, October 6, 
2019. The election took place before the COVID-19 pandemic was declared a 
pandemic on March 11, 2020, although fieldwork for the study was conducted 
during the pandemic. The post-election study was fielded between July 18
and July 30, 2020 (11 days in total) and was administered face-to-face using 
an electronic questionnaire in Arabic, by the polling agency One to One for 
Research and Polling. COVID-19 restrictions in Tunisia were eased in 
Summer 2020, permitting face-to-face fieldwork. The total number of 
observations from the Tunisia Study is 1,477 interviews.

To be interviewed, a person needed to be a Tunisian citizen 18 years old or
older. Institutionalized persons were excluded from the sample as surveys 
were only conducted within households.  The 2019 Tunisian Study used a 
stratified multi-stage probability sample. The primary sampling units (PSU) 
are the smallest units in the sampling frame called blocks. The PSUs are 
randomly selected with the population proportional to size method. 
Tunisia is divided into 24 governorates, 264 delegations and 2,084 sectors. 
Each sector was divided into two independent categories: urban and rural. 
The population was classified into 46 strata (two governorates, namely 
Tunis and Monastir, are 100% urban). The sectors were then divided into 
"blocks". The total number of blocks was 27,466. 
The largest administrative unit, namely each governorate, got a portion of 
the sample based on the percentage of the population related to the total 
population. The rural and urban areas in each governorate then received a 
portion from the sampling points based on the percentage of each area 
within the governorate. The three stages of selection were: selecting the 
blocks, selecting households, and selecting respondents. In the final 
stage, the interviewers used the Kish table to randomly select one 
respondent. From one house to another, the interviewers alternated between 
female and male.

>>> OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND WEIGHTS - TURKEY (2018)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The 2018 Turkish General Elections took place on Sunday, June 24, 2018. 
This study was a post-election cross-sectional study, with fieldwork 
taking place between July 23, 2018 and September 9, 2018 (49 days in total). 
The fieldwork was conducted by Frekans Arastirma and the questionnaire 
was administered face-to-face using a paper questionnaire in Turkish. The 
total number of observations from the Turkey Study is 1,069 interviews. 

The sample is designed to be representative of the Turkish voting-age 
population (i.e., citizens aged 18 years or older). Institutionalized 
persons in prisons or hospitals and military personnel were excluded from 
the sampling frame (estimated to be 1% of the voting-eligible population).
The sample was realized as a stratified multi-stage random sample. NUTS-2 
regions, as given by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK), formed the 
basis for stratification. In the first step, the target sample
was stratified according to each region's share of the urban and rural 
population following the Address-Based Population Registration System 
(ADNKS) records as of the end of 2017.
Next, TUIK's address block data were used with a block size set at 400 
residents. Address blocks were the primary sampling unit. Twenty voters were
targeted to be reached within each block, and no substitution was allowed. 
Based on the probability proportionate to population size (PPPS) principle,
blocks were distributed to NUT1 regions.
In a third step, for each of the twenty addresses within each block, up to 
three visits were carried out with the expectation that approximately 50% 
of the addresses would result in a completed interview. In rural areas where
TUIK was unable to provide addresses, Collaborators contacted the village's
headman (muhtar) and selected twenty addresses in a systematic random sample
from the list of households in the village. 

To select individuals within sampled households, names of all reported 
eligible household members were written on cards. Then, a person in the 
household was asked to randomly select one card with the name of the 
individual to be interviewed. If, for any reason, the selected individual
could not participate in the survey at the first visit, the same household
was visited up to three times to obtain the interview. If the interview 
could not be realized after three visits, the respective household was 
dropped from the sample without being substituted.


<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS 

The 2018 Turkey Study includes a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT. The weight adjusts 
the sample to the following known population distributions of gender, age, 
and educational attainment: Males and Females, six age groups (18-24, 25-34, 
35-44, 45-54, 55-64 and 65+-year-olds), and five education groups (below 
primary school, primary school graduates, secondary school graduates, high
school graduates, University graduates and above).
The resulting 60 cells (2 x 6 x 5) were filled with the respective 
respondents from within the sample to calculate the weight and to obtain 
the national aggregates. As there are minor variations in the geographic 
planned distribution of observations and realized interviews, Collaborators 
calculated a separate geographic weight. The Demographic Weight included in 
CSES is the product of this Geographic Weight and the Demographic Weight 
described above.

>>> OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND WEIGHTS - UNITED STATES (2016)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN 

The 2016 United States general election was held on Tuesday, November 8,
2016 and was part of the larger American National Election Study (ANES).  
The ANES 2016 Time Series has a pre and post-election panel design in which 
respondents were interviewed twice: once before the election and once after. 
The CSES sample only includes respondents who took part in both rounds of 
interviews. The study features a mixed-mode design combining face-to-face 
interviewing with an electronic questionnaire with a separate sample 
interviewed on the Internet. Respondents were assigned to modes which 
remained consistent. Fieldwork featuring the CSES survey started on 
November 9, 2016, and continued until January 9, 2017 (61 days in total). 
The study was fielded by Westat, Inc. in both English and Spanish. The total 
number of observations from the United States Study is 3,648 interviews: 
1,058 via face-to-face, and 2,590 via the Internet.

Probability samples were drawn independently for face-to-face and Internet
components. Both samples are meant to be representative of U.S. citizens 
aged 18 or older at the time of recruitment. As the sampling frame for both 
modes was composed of lists of residential addresses provided by the U.S. 
Postal Service, a respondent had to reside at the sampled address to be 
eligible. Addresses where mail is not delivered were excluded from the 
sampling frame. Residents from the states of Alaska and Hawaii were not 
sampled for face-to-face interviews (less than one percent of the 
population). Furthermore, addresses associated with more than one 
dwelling unit ("drop point addresses") were excluded from the sampling 
frame for Internet surveys (2.9 percent of residential addresses). 

The face-to-face sample was realized as a multi-stage stratified cluster 
sample. Primary sampling units (PSUs) were counties, or a combination of
counties, with a minimum population of 50,000 people. The Los Angeles 
County was divided into two PSUs due to its large size. For the 
face-to-face mode, 60 PSUs were selected with probability proportional to 
the number of adult citizens, previously stratified by Census region, the 
prevalence of poverty, members of minority groups and population size. The 
five largest PSUs were selected with certainty.
In the second stage, within each PSU, four Census Block groups were drawn as 
the secondary sampling units. Within these areas, households were sampled 
randomly from addresses included in the U.S. Postal Service's computerized
delivery sequence file (DSF). Interviewers were sent to the sampled address 
and conducted a brief screening interview in which eligible respondents 
from the household were listed. One person was randomly selected from this 
list. During the last two weeks of pre-election fieldwork, half of the 
remaining eligible cases were sub-sampled out to concentrate resources on
a smaller set of cases (adaptive design).
Depending on the level of pre-election incentives, respondents were
initially offered 25, 50 or 100 USD for completing the post-election 
interview. These amounts were increased to 50 or 100 USD, respectively, at
the end of the fielding period.

The Internet sample is based on a simple random sample from the list from  
the DSF file, excluding drop point addresses and addresses contacted for the 
ANES pretest. Selected addresses were sent letters asking one household 
member to go online to complete a survey. That survey contained a 
screening instrument to randomly select one person from all eligible 
household members for the final interview. 
For post-election Internet interviews, incentives were set to the amount 
paid for the pre-election interview, that is, either 40 or 80 USD.
Panel attrition rates were 10 percent for the face-to-face component, and 
16 percent for the Internet component. 


<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS 

The 2016 United States Study includes a COMBINED SAMPLE and DEMOGRAPHIC
WEIGHT. The weight adjusts for unequal probability of selection, non-
response, age by gender, race/ethnicity by educational attainment, marital 
status by gender, race/ethnicity by census region, nation of birth and home 
tenure by metropolitan status.
The weight deposited with CSES is targeted to the complete U.S. 2016 
dataset (including both Internet and face-to-face modes). Users interested 
in conducting analyses with either face-to-face or web interviews only are 
referred to the ANES 2016 Time Series Study, which provides individual 
weights for each mode.

>>> OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND WEIGHTS - UNITED STATES (2020)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN 

The 2020 United States general election was held on Tuesday, November 3,
2020 and was part of the larger American National Election Study (ANES). 
The elections and the fieldwork took place during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The ANES 2020 Time Series study has a pre and post-election panel design in 
which 4,779 respondents were interviewed twice: once before the election and 
once after. Another 2,670 respondents were sampled for the 2016 ANES Time 
Series Study and were re-interviewed in 2020 before and after the election. 
The CSES sample includes respondents sampled in 2016 and 2020 who took part 
in both rounds of the 2020 interviews.

Fieldwork featuring the CSES survey started on November 8, 2020, and 
continued until January 4, 2021 (58 days in total). The COVID-19 pandemic 
made face-to-face interviewing unfeasible. In response, the 2020 ANES 
implemented a contactless, sequential mixed-mode design. This design 
combined self-administered Internet surveys, live in-person video 
interviews, and telephone interviews. Respondents were assigned to modes 
which remained consistent. The study was fielded by Westat, Inc. in both 
English and Spanish. The total number of observations from the United States 
Study is 7,449 interviews: 115 were completed via telephone, 7,060 via the 
Internet, and 274 using in-person video call. 

The fresh 2020 cross-sectional sample is meant to represent eligible voters
in the 2020 Presidential election, as defined by being age 18 as of election
day and being a U.S. citizen. Institutionalized persons were excluded from 
the sampling frame. Further details on the sampling process with which 
panelists from 2016 were recruited are detailed in CSES Codebook Part 6 in
the "Overview of Study Design and Weights - United States (2016)". 

The 2020 fresh cross-sectional sample is based on a simple random sample
drawn from the computerized delivery sequence file (C-DSF) provided by 
the U.S. Postal Service. All included residential addresses across the 50 
states and Washington DC had an equal probability of selection. 
Selected addresses were sent a series of letters, asking one household 
member to go online to complete a survey. That survey contained a screening 
instrument to randomly select one person from all eligible household members
for the final interview. Upon completion of the screener, the selected 
individual was randomly assigned to one of three sequential mode conditions:
Internet-only, mixed Internet, and mixed video.

Cases assigned to the Internet-only group were released in two replicates 
for the pre-election survey and solely interviewed online. The first was
released in mid-August 2020 with the other sample groups. The second 
replicate was released on September 11, 2020, after the Republican and 
Democratic conventions, roughly corresponding to the field period of 
previous ANES Time Series studies.
Respondents in the mixed Internet group were initially invited to complete  
the survey online. Non-responding persons and refusals were shifted to the 
telephone at the case level in the final weeks of the pre-election period. 
Finally, upon completing the web screener, respondents in the mixed video 
group were invited to complete the survey by live video interview via Zoom. 
Following the invitation link, respondents were instructed to wait briefly
to connect with an interviewer or set an appointment. In case of refusal or 
non-response, respondents were shifted to the Internet. At the final stage, 
non-respondents to the Internet survey were subsequently pushed to 
telephone. Similar to the mixed Internet group, this shift occurred at the 
case level in the final weeks of the pre-election period. All panelists 
from the 2016 ANES Time Series study completed the 2020 survey via the 
Internet. Invitations were made by e-mail and mail.

Before the pre-election interview, selected addresses were sent invitation
letters, including 10 USD in cash, that promised an additional 40 USD for 
completing a survey online. Among all groups of the fresh 2020 sample, 
non-responding households were offered escalated incentives of 100 USD for 
completing the screener later in the field period. Additionally, individuals
from under-represented groups with a low response rate were offered 200 USD
as part of a targeted, adaptive design approach in the mixed-Internet group
and for panelists from 2016. Likewise, to counter initial non-response, 
200 USD escalations were offered to respondents from the mixed video group 
for completing interviews by video. 
For the post-election survey, pre-election respondents were offered the 
incentive amount they received previously.

The pre-election re-interview rate for the 2016-2020 panel cases was 77.9%.
Of these, post-election re-interviews were conducted with 94.0% of 
panelists. The cumulative 2020 re-interview rate was thus 73.2%.
For the fresh 2020 sample, 87.9% of respondents from the pre-election survey
also completed the post-election interview (88.1% in Internet-only, 88.7% in 
mixed Internet and 84.6% in the mixed video group, respectively). 


<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS 

The 2020 United States Study includes a COMBINED SAMPLE and DEMOGRAPHIC 
WEIGHT. The weight adjusts for unequal probability of selection, non-
response, age by gender, marital status by gender, race/ethnicity by 
educational attainment, race/ethnicity by Census region, nation of birth, 
home tenure by metropolitan status, population density, household income, 
and early voter status.
The weight deposited with CSES (variable V200010b in the ANES 2020 Time 
Series data) is targeted to the full post-election dataset, namely all three
mode conditions from the 2020 fresh cross-sectional sample and sample 
members from the 2016 ANES Time Series Study. Users interested in conducting
analyses with a subset of these sample components only are referred to the 
ANES 2020 Time Series Study, which provides individual weights for selected 
components.

>>> OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN AND WEIGHTS - URUGUAY (2019)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> STUDY DESIGN

The 2019 Uruguayan general election took place on Sunday, October 27, 2019. 
The Uruguayan Study was carried out between January 28 and February 27, 
2020 (31 days) with interviews conducted by telephone. The questionnaire was 
administered in Spanish, and the fieldwork was carried out by Instituto 
Factum. The total number of observations from the Uruguay Study is 1,200 
interviews. 

The sample is meant to be representative of the voting-eligible population,
namely, Uruguayan citizens aged 18 years or older on election day. The 
survey was realized as a two-stage quota sample with departments as the 
primary sampling unit. The departments were selected proportionally to the
electorates and hence not randomly. In a subsequent step, dual-frame 
telephone surveys were conducted within departments (50% mobiles and 50%
landlines). While mobile phone numbers were sampled via random digit 
dialing, landline numbers originate from a listed sample. Apart from 
clustering by departments, the sample design includes quota sampling by sex
and age.


<<>> POLITY WEIGHTS 

The 2019 Uruguay Study provides a SAMPLE WEIGHT, a DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT, and 
a POLITICAL WEIGHT. The sample weight is designed to account for a 
sampling bias related to the different Uruguayan territories (based on 
variable E2022 - Rural or Urban Residence). The demographic weight controls 
for gender and age. The political weight adjusts for discrepancies in the 
reported electoral behavior of respondents and the official electoral 
results.
