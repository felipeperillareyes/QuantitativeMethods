These materials are based on work supported by the American National
Science Foundation (www.nsf.gov) under grant numbers SES-1420973 and
SES-1760058, the GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, 
the University of Michigan, in-kind support of participating election 
studies, the many organizations that sponsor planning meetings and 
conferences, and the numerous organizations that fund national 
election studies by CSES Collaborators.

Any opinions, findings and conclusions, or recommendations expressed
in these materials are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily

===========================================================================

NOTE TO USERS:

We recommend that researchers become familiar with the CSES design, units 
of analysis, documentation, and dataset weights before beginning their 
investigations. For instance, while the set of respondents appearing within
each election study represents their respective nations, the group of 
nations that appear within CSES is not a random sample of countries 
worldwide. Furthermore, while many election studies include 1,000 or so 
respondents, other election studies may consist of over 10,000 respondents. 
Some nations will have studies of more than one election in a CSES module,
and occasionally there will be two independent studies of a single 
election. Last, some election studies include oversamples of specific 
subpopulations or would otherwise benefit from use of the included weight
variables. We hope you find our website and documentation useful as you 
proceed with your work, and welcome any questions or suggestions you have.

))) OVERVIEW OF "CODEBOOK PART 4: PRIMARY ELECTORAL DISTRICTS" 
===========================================================================

Part 4 of the CSES Codebook presents the primary electoral districts by
polity, which refer to the constituency/riding/district in which an 
individual respondent in a survey votes. 
These value labels refer to coders reported in variable 
E2021 "PRIMARY ELECTORAL DISTRICT" detailed in CSES Codebook Part 2. 

These districts are sometimes identified "indirectly," through postal 
codes, etc... by the CSES Secretariat with the assistance of the 
national Collaborators. Where postal codes, etc., were ambiguous,
cases are coded missing. Wherever possible, CSES uses the labels used 
by each country's electoral commission. 

Only districts where respondents are in the CSES data are listed (see 
second column of Table below). Polities are listed in alphabetical order.

))) HOW TO NAVIGATE THE CSES MODULE 5 CODEBOOK
===========================================================================

In the CSES MODULE 5 dataset, all variables begin with the letter "E" 
(E being the fifth letter of the English alphabet and thus signifying 
MODULE 5).

The CSES codebook is especially extensive and users are advised that the 
best way to navigate it is electronically. It is a .txt format which 
allows it to be accessed via a variety of programs. 

The CSES Codebook can be navigated quickly in the electronic files, with 
the following commands allowing for quick searching:

))) = Section Header 

>>> = Sub-section Header 1

<<>> = Sub-section Header 2 

+++ = Tables

CSES QUESTION CLASSIFICATION = For survey level variables only, CSES  
Question Classification details whether the variable is part of the CSES  
Core component, which are questions asked repeatedly in CSES Modules, 
whether a variable is part of the CSES Module Theme component, which are  
questions specific to the Module Theme under exploration and might not be 
included in CSES repeatedly, or whether a variable is a Derivative Variable, 
which is explained below. 

VARIABLE NOTES = Notes for particular variables 

ELECTION STUDY NOTES = Notes for a particular election study  

DERIVATIVE VARIABLE = Highlights a variable derived from another 
variable or variables within the CSES.

POTENTIAL POLITY LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging at polity level.

POTENTIAL REGIONAL LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging at regional level.

POTENTIAL TIME BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging by time.

POTENTIAL PARTY/COALITION LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = Highlights a variable 
that may be used for data bridging at party/coalition level.

POTENTIAL CSES PRODUCT BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = Highlights a variable 
that may be used for data bridging with other CSES products.

For further details on the CSES MODULE 5 documentation, users are advised
to consult Part 1 of the CSES Codebook.

         | In the sampling procedure, Collaborators selected 4,000 addresses
         | in the Wallonia from the National Register. Primary electoral 
         | districts are derived from postal codes, which were reported by
         | respondents themselves. Thus, some respondents report to be from
         | Brussels, even though Brussels was not sampled for the Belgium -
         | Wallonia (2019) study. Primary electoral districts remain 
         | unchanged, and district data is added as if these respondents 
         | are from Brussels.

         |
         | For elections to the Seimas, Lithuania's unicameral parliament, 
         | boundaries of the 71 single-member constituencies are determined
         | anew before every election. Therefore, districts from the 
         | Lithuanian 2016 election do not map to districts for 2020. 
         | According to the OSCE election report, boundaries for all but 17
         | of the 71 districts were changed considerably (OSCE ODIHR 
         | Election Expert Team Report on the October 11 and 25 2020 
         | Parliamentary Elections, available at 
         | https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/e/a/477730_0.pdf

         |                                        DISTRICTS
         |
         | The first two values in the district codes correspond to the
         | Federal States. The last two values indicate the electoral 
         | district.
         | 
         | Three alliances formed in the 2018 Mexican election. All of them    
         | formed in some, but not all electoral districts.
         | ALLIANCE 1, "Together We Will Make History" consisted of the
         | National Regeneration Movement (MORENA, PARTY A), the Labor 
         | Party (PT, PARTY G), and the Social Encounter Party 
         | (PES, PARTY I).
         | ALLIANCE 2, "For Mexico to the Front" encompassed the National 
         | Action Party (PAN, PARTY B), the Party of the Democratic 
         | Revolution (PRD, PARTY D), and Citizens' Movement (MC, PARTY F).
         | ALLIANCE 3, "Everyone for Mexico" was made up of the 
         | Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI, PARTY C), the Ecologist 
         | Green Party of Mexico (PVEM, PARTY E), and the New Alliance Party 
         | (PNA, PARTY H). 
         | As alliances nominated joint candidates, no district-level 
         | information was available for the individual parties composing 
         | the alliances. Instead, vote shares for the alliances are coded 
         | into the party variable of the biggest party of the alliance 
         | (i.e., PARTIES A, B, and C). Where applicable, variables for the 
         | minor parties of the respective alliance are set to missing 
         | (PARTIES D - I).

         | Seven of Portugal's 22 districts operated for the lower house 
         | elections are not represented in the sample. The two districts
         | reserved for Portuguese living abroad and the autonomous regions
         | of Madeira and the Azores were excluded from the sampling frame. 
         | Further, discrepancies between sampling regions and electoral 
         | districts result in under coverage of the Braganca, Guarda and 
         | Leiria districts. Stratified sampling was based on population 
         | size and EU NUTS II regions, whose boundaries do not correspond 
         | to those of electoral districts.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - UNITED STATES (2016): PRIMARY ELECTORAL
         |                                              DISTRICTS
         |
         | District data given in E4001-E4007 refer to the U.S. 2016 
         | Presidential election, while codes listed above indicate 
         | Congressional Districts.
         | For Presidential elections, the United States use an electoral
         | college system, a system which sees the Presidential candidate
         | who wins in a state awarded its electoral college votes (except
         | for Maine and Nebraska where electoral votes are awarded on the
         | basis of who wins congressional districts within the state).
         | Hence, the first three digits of electoral district codes above 
         | refer to the state the respondent resided in. 
         | Together with the first three digits, the last two digits 
         | specify Congressional Districts, which are also listed
         | after the state name. 
         | U.S. states, the geographical level E4001-E4007 refer to, are 
         | provided in E2020 (REGION OF RESIDENCE).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - UNITED STATES (2020): PRIMARY ELECTORAL
         |                                              DISTRICTS
         |                                        
         | District data given in E4001-E4007 refer to the U.S. 2020  
         | Presidential elections, while codes listed above indicate 
         | Congressional Districts.
         | For Presidential elections, the United States use an electoral
         | college system, a system which sees the Presidential candidate
         | who wins in a state awarded its electoral college votes (except
         | for Maine and Nebraska, where electoral votes are awarded on the
         | basis of who wins congressional districts within the state).
         | Hence, the first three digits of electoral district codes above 
         | refer to the state the respondent resided in. 
         | Together with the first three digits, the last two digits 
         | specify Congressional Districts, which are also listed
         | after the state name. 
         | U.S. states, the geographical level E4001-E4007 refer to, are 
         | provided in E2020 (REGION OF RESIDENCE).
