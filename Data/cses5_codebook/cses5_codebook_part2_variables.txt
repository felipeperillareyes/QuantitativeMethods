These materials are based on work supported by the American National
Science Foundation (www.nsf.gov) under grant numbers SES-1420973 and
SES-1760058, the GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, 
the University of Michigan, in-kind support of participating election
studies, the many organizations that sponsor planning meetings and 
conferences, and the numerous organizations that fund national 
election studies by CSES Collaborators.

Any opinions, findings and conclusions, or recommendations expressed
in these materials are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily
reflect the views of the funding organizations.

===========================================================================

NOTE TO USERS:

We recommend that researchers become familiar with the CSES design, units 
of analysis, documentation, and dataset weights before beginning their 
investigations. For instance, while the set of respondents appearing within
each election study represents their respective nations, the group of 
nations that appear within CSES is not a random sample of countries 
worldwide. Furthermore, while many election studies include 1,000 or so 
respondents, other election studies may consist of over 10,000 respondents. 
Some nations will have studies of more than one election in a CSES module,
and occasionally there will be two independent studies of a single 
election. Last, some election studies include oversamples of specific 
subpopulations or would otherwise benefit from use of the included weight
variables. We hope you find our website and documentation useful as you 
proceed with your work, and welcome any questions or suggestions you have.

))) OVERVIEW OF "CODEBOOK PART 2: VARIABLES DESCRIPTION"
===========================================================================

Part 2 of the CSES Codebook provides users with information about the 
variables in the CSES dataset as well as accompanying information about
each polity's election study. 


===========================================================================
))) HOW TO NAVIGATE THE CSES MODULE 5 CODEBOOK
===========================================================================

In the CSES MODULE 5 dataset, all variables begin with the letter "E" 
(E being the fourth letter of the English alphabet and thus signifying 
MODULE 5).

The CSES Codebook is especially extensive and users are advised that the 
best way to navigate it is electronically. It is a .txt format which 
allows it to be accessed via a variety of programs. 

In this part of the Codebook (Part 2), the headers for individual variables
are surrounded by two lines of dashes. For e.g., 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
VARIABLE NAME                  VARIABLE DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CSES Codebook can be navigated quickly in the electronic files, with 
the following commands allowing for quick searching:

))) = Section Header. 

>>> = Sub-section Header 1.

<<>> = Sub-section Header 2. 

+++ = Tables.

CSES QUESTION CLASSIFICATION = For survey level variables only, CSES  
Question Classification details whether the variable is part of the CSES  
Core component, which are questions asked repeatedly in CSES Modules, 
whether a variable is part of the CSES Module Theme component, which are  
questions specific to the Module Theme under exploration and might not be 
included in CSES repeatedly, or whether a variable is a Derivative Variable, 
which is explained below. 

VARIABLE NOTES = Notes for particular variables.

ELECTION STUDY NOTES = Notes for a particular election study .

DERIVATIVE VARIABLE = Highlights a variable derived from another 
variable or variables within the CSES.

POTENTIAL POLITY LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging at polity level.

POTENTIAL REGIONAL LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging at regional level.

POTENTIAL TIME BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging by time.

POTENTIAL PARTY/COALITION LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = Highlights a variable 
that may be used for data bridging at party/coalition level.

POTENTIAL CSES PRODUCT BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = Highlights a variable 
that may be used for data bridging with other CSES products.

For further details on the CSES MODULE 5 documentation, users are advised
to consult Part 1 of the CSES Codebook.

))) CSES CODEBOOK - VARIABLE NOTES AND ELECTION STUDY NOTES
===========================================================================

<<>> VARIABLE NOTES

Variable notes provide information on the rationale of a variable 
as well as source information for that variable. It also details the 
polities for which no data for that particular variable are available. 
VARIABLE NOTES are listed below the descriptive information for the said
variable and can be navigated in the Codebook by searching for 
"VARIABLE NOTES" in Part 2 of the CSES Codebook. 

<<>> ELECTION STUDY NOTES

A unique dimension of the CSES are the inclusion of ELECTION STUDY NOTES. 
They are notes which are attached to each variable included in the dataset
and refer to case-specific information regarding a particular variable. 
Their purpose is to provide users with more detailed information on the 
case or explain essential deviations specific to cases from CSES 
conventions. They are also used to provide source data information for 
users. Where applicable, ELECTION STUDY NOTES are listed below a particular
variable and any VARIABLE NOTES in Part 2 and 3 of the CSES Codebook. They
can be navigated in the Codebook by searching for "ELECTION STUDY NOTES" in
Parts 2-4 of the CSES Codebook.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
))) DERIVATIVE VARIABLES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSES MODULE 5 includes several derivative variables. A derivative variable 
is a variable that is derived from another variable or variables within the 
CSES. Their purpose is to facilitate speedier analysis for users with 
derivative variables capturing some of the most common analytical concepts 
in the discipline.

A list of the DERIVATIVE VARIABLES are below this explanation and can be
navigated in the Codebook by searching for DERIVATIVE VARIABLES in
Part 2 of the CSES MODULE 5 Codebook.

===========================================================================
))) CSES MODULE 5 CODING OF PARTIES/COALITIONS & LEADERS
===========================================================================

CSES codes parties/coalitions in its dataset numerically and
alphabetically. Below we provide explanations of both of these coding
schemes. The details of each party/leader classification are available in  
Part 3 of the Codebook. 

<<>> CSES NUMERICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING

Each party is assigned a unique numerical code which consists of two 
components and six digits in total:
    - the first three digits indicate the numerical country UN code
    - the latter three digits indicate the numerical party code within
      the given election study.

All parties/coalitions or Presidential candidates, where applicable,
participating in the election or the previous election receive a numerical
code. These codes are used to identify the following: 
    - who respondents feel best represented by (variable E3010_2).
    - who a respondent voted for in the current election 
      (variable E3013).
    - who the respondent voted for in the previous election 
      (variable E3015).
    - the respondent's party identification (variable E3024).
      
The numeric coding is also used to identify macro level information about
the parties/coalitions, namely: 
    - numeric party code identifiers for relational data (E5000)
    - which party/coalition held the presidency before and after the
      elections (variable E5009 and E5013).
    - which party/coalition held the Prime Ministership before and after
      the elections (variable E5010 and E5014).

Numerical codes assigned to parties/coalitions are consistent for the 
current and previous election.  

<<>> CSES ALPHABETICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING
 
Parties A through F are the six most popular parties/coalitions, ordered in
descending order of their share of the popular vote in the parliamentary 
election (unless otherwise stated). Thus Party A is the party/coalition
that received the most votes in the election, party B the second most
votes, etc...

Parties/coalitions who achieve at least 1% of the vote nationally are
eligible for an alphabetical A-F assignment. In countries with multiple
electoral tiers and where one vote is cast, parties are ordered according
to their vote share in tier 1 (the lowest tier), unless otherwise stated.
In countries where voters have two votes (i.e., a constituency and a list
vote) simultaneously, for example Germany, parties are ordered by the
national share of the party list vote (tier 2).

Parties G, H, and I are supplemental parties. They may, but do not have to,
accord with how parties A-F are ordered, that is ordered on the popular 
share of the vote in a country. More often, they are codified in no 
particular order. These parties are voluntarily provided by each country's
election study and often reflect important or notable parties within a 
country. They may also include data about individual parties within a 
coalition, where data about the coalition and the individual parties, 
or some of these parties that make it up, are provided.
These codes are used to identify the following in the micro component of 
the CSES dataset: 
    - Respondent's likeability of the party/coalition (variable E3017).
    - Respondent's left-right placement of the party/coalition (variable 
      E3019).
    - Respondent's placement of the party/coalition on an alternative 
      scale, if applicable (variable E3021).

These alphabetical codes are used to identify district and macro level
information about these said parties/coalitions, namely:
    - The said party/coalition's vote share in the respondent's electoral
      district (variable E4004).
    - the said party/coalition's share of the seats in the election in the
      respondent's electoral district (variable E4005)
    - the said party/coalition's share of the vote in the election 
      (variable E5001, E5003, and E5005).
    - the said party/coalition's share of the seats in the election 
      (variable E5002 and E5004).
    - the said party/coalition's share of cabinet portfolios before and 
      after the election (variable E5011 and E5015).
    - expert judgments by the national Collaborators of the said party/
      coalition's ideological family (variable E5017).
    - expert judgments by the national Collaborators of the said party/
      coalition's left-right placement (variable E5018).
    - expert judgments by the national Collaborators of the said party/
      coalition's placement on an alternative scale, if applicable 
      (variable E5019).     
    - expert judgments by the national Collaborators of the said party/
      coalition's level of populism (variable E5020).
    - The said party/coalition's Manifesto Research on Political 
      Representation (MARPOR/CMP) Identifier (variable E5200).
    - The said party/coalition's Parliaments and Government Database
      (ParlGov) Identifier (variable E5201).
    - The said party/coalition's Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES) 
      Identifier (variable E5202).
    - The said party/coalition's Party Facts Identifier (variable E5203).
 
<<>> CSES ALPHABETICAL LEADER CODING
         
Leaders A through F tend to be the leaders of the six most popular parties/
coalitions or the Presidential candidates of these parties. They correspond
to parties A-F (i.e., Leader A will be related to Party A in some way,
Leader B will be related to Party B, etc.).

Leaders G, H, and I are supplemental leaders. They may be related to
parties G, H, I, but they do not have to be. These leaders are voluntarily
provided by each country's election study and often include data about
additional personalities of interest. For example, in a parliamentary
system, data about a President might be provided, even if the Presidency
is not being contested. On many occasions, slots Leader G, H, and I will
include additional data for parties/coalitions that have multiple leaders.
These codes are used to identify the following in the micro and macro
components of the CSES dataset: 
    - Respondent's likeability of the leader/personality in question
      (variable E3018).


===========================================================================
))) CSES DATA BRIDGING: NEW FRONTIERS
===========================================================================

Data Bridging enables users to bring together information from CSES with 
other data sources. The concept is part of CSES Data Linkage efforts. CSES
has been a pioneer of Data Linkage with the inclusion of various 
macro-level data originating from other sources (e.g., The World Bank, 
the IDEA) directly in CSES data products, including in CSES MODULE 5. These 
macro data classify the political system's characteristics and contextual 
conditions of a polity at the election time.  
Data Bridging gives users the power to build on the direct data linkage 
in CSES products by enabling users to easily link other data with CSES 
products. CSES MODULE 5 enables users to bridge data with other prominent 
datasets in political science by including standard identifiers at the
polity, year, and party level used by other projects to facilitate 
merging.

CSES MODULE 5 facilitates data bridging with other datasets at the polity 
level with the following variables:
    - E1006_UN       ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN ISO_3166-1 NUMERIC CODE
    - E1006_UNALPHA2 ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN ISO_3166-1 ALPHABETIC
                                    TWO LETTER CODE
    - E1006_NAM      ID COMPONENT - POLITY NAME
    - E1006_VDEM     ID COMPONENT - V-Dem POLITY IDENTIFIER
    
More details can be found on all these variables in CSES Codebook Part 2
by searching for the variable name (e.g., "E1006_UN") or using the search
term "POTENTIAL POLITY LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER". 


CSES MODULE 5 facilitates data bridging with other datasets at the regional
level through the following variables:  
    - E1006_REG      ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS NUMERIC
                                    CODES
More details can be found on all these variables in CSES Codebook Part 2
by searching for the variable name (e.g., "E1006_REG") or using the search
term "POTENTIAL REGIONAL LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER". 


CSES MODULE 5 facilitates data bridging with other datasets by date through
the following variables:  
    - E1008_YEAR     ID COMPONENT - ELECTION YEAR
    - E1016          DATE 1ST ROUND ELECTION BEGAN - MONTH
    - E1017          DATE 1ST ROUND ELECTION BEGAN - DAY

More details can be found on all these variables in CSES Codebook Part 2
by searching for the variable name (e.g., "E1008_YEAR") or using the search
term "POTENTIAL TIME BRIDGING IDENTIFIER". 


CSES MODULE 5 facilitates data bridging with other datasets at the
party/coalition level with the following variables: 
    - E5200_A-I      MANIFESTO RESEARCH ON POLITICAL REPRESENTATION 
                     (MARPOR/CMP) IDENTIFIER - PARTY A-I

         | E1005 is an eighteen character variable uniquely identifying a
         | respondent within CSES MODULE 5.
         | The variable is constructed from three components: variable
         | E1006 (CSES polity code), E1008 (election year), and E1009 
         | (respondent within election study).
         |
         | The first three characters are the numeric version of the
         | country codes created by the United Nations Statistics
         | Division ("countries or areas, codes and abbreviations",
         | revised February 13, 2002).
         | If appropriate, the fourth character distinguishes between
         | multiple studies conducted within a single country, for the same
         | election. If only one study is in place for the election, this
         | character appears as a zero (0).
         |
         | The fifth through eighth characters correspond to the election
         | year as specified in variable E1008.
         |
         | The last ten characters are the respondent identifier from E1009,
         | which is unique within each election study.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - JAPAN (2017): E1005
         |
         | Respondent identifiers are originally composed of three 
         | variables: Branch (2 digits), Point (3 digits), & RID (2 digits).
         | The value of Branch starts from "00", Point starts from "000", 
         | and RID begins from "00." Consequently, there is one respondent
         | with a respondent ID composed of all zeros.

         | E1006_NAM is a string variable identifying a polity conducting
         | an election study present in CSES MODULE 5.
         |
         | E1006_NAM consists of polity names based on those principally 
         | used by the United Nations Statistics Division ("Countries or 
         | areas, codes and abbreviations", revised February 13, 2002). 
         | However, in  some instances, polity names deviate from those used 
         | by the United Nations.

         |
         | In 2022, the Turkish government officially changed the polity's   
         | name from Turkey to Tuerkiye. But CSES uses the name of a polity 
         | as of the election date (in Turkey's case 2018). Hence, this 
         | nomenclature is used for CSES MODULE 5.

         | E1007 details the number of sampling components included in a

         | of language, pre- and post-election designs, oversampling of 
         | selected subpopulations, etc.  
         | In some cases, analysts may wish to consider regions of polities

         | questionnaire was administered to a respondent or timing of

         | The data collection organization programmed the questionnaire
         | incorrectly and consequently, 288 respondents were not asked
         | several items in the Finnish study. This affected two CSES
         | items: turnout and vote choice variables.
         | The error was detected after the data collection had concluded.
         | To amend the problem, the data collection organization attempted
         | to re-contact the affected respondents by phone and ask the
         | questions that had not been included during the initial
         | interview. The affected respondents did not retake the entire
         | interview.
         | Thus, E1007 distinguishes between the following three categories 
         | of respondents:

         | The Dutch 2021 Parliamentary Election Study (DPES) consists of 
         | two independent sampling components, a simple random sample 
         | drawn from population registers (N = 1,688) and a sample drawn 
         | from the ongoing "LISS" online panel (N = 1,766) (Langlopende 
         | Internet Studies voor de Sociale wetenschappen). 
         | The LISS panel was launched in 2007 and refreshed in five 
         | subsequent waves, all based on probability sampling. 
         | Respondents from both components were interviewed both before 
         | and after the election. As the DPES spread CSES-related 
         | questions throughout pre- and post-election interviews, the 
         | CSES retained only those respondents who participated in both
         | the pre- and post-election interviews. 
         | Wherever possible, the post-election survey was used for coding
         | CSES variables. For variables in which this is not the case, 
         | there is a reference in the Election Study Notes.

         |
         | The fieldwork for the Slovakian study was conducted from June to
         | August 2020, as a face-to-face study, in the midst of the
         | COVID-19 pandemic. Due to lockdown measures in some parts of the
         | country and a shortage of interviewers because of the pandemic, 
         | about 20% of selected primary sampling units (PSUs) were not 
         | reachable. To compensate for this, Slovakian Collaborators 
         | decided to conduct a second round of PSU-selection again based
         | on the whole country. This resulted in a second round of
         | fieldwork to collect the missing approx. 33% of the sample.

         | person, due to relocation, decease, illnesses etc. Substituted 
         | individuals were sampled in the same manner as regular

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - UNITED STATES (2020): E1007
         |
         | E1007 differentiates between ten sample components in the 2020 
         | study. These ten sample components comprise two-digit identifiers   
         | which represent the following distinctions. The first digit 
         | (a "1" or a "2") differentiates between voters that report 
         | casting their ballot before the pre-election and those who report 
         | doing so after the pre-election interview. Voters who report the
         | former receive a code of "2" (and thus are represented by codes
         | 21-25, N=371). Voters who report the latter receive a code of "1"
         | and thus are represented by codes 11-15. 
         |
         | The second digit of the identifier classifies the respondent 
         | mode of interview and in certain circumstances, the timing period
         | in which the respondent was invited to undertake the interview.   
         | Respondents part of the 2020 sample are classified with a second 
         | digit (i.e., codes 11-14 and codes 21-24 respectively). The two
         | replicates (codes 11 & 12 and 21 and 22) comprise respondents 
         | invited to undertake the interview before the party conventions 
         | (replicate 1 - codes 11 and 21 respectively) and after the party
         | conventions (replicate 2 - codes 12 and 22 respectively).          
         | Respondents originating from the ANES 2016 study and 
         | re-interviewed in 2020 are classified in codes 15 and 25.      
         | Further details on the 2020 sampling components are provided in

         | VARIABLE NOTES: E1009_P1
         |
         | E1009_P1 details whether a respondent completed the CSES MODULE 5
         | Questionnaire multiple times or not. A CSES Module is often 
         | administered multiple times within one polity but conventionally,
         | it is administered on fresh cross-sectional samples of the 
         | polity's population. However, in rare circumstances, the module
         | has been administered multiple times to the same respondent at
         | different time intervals. Consequently, E1009_P1 applies only to
         | respondents originating from studies that administered CSES 
         | MODULE 5 in a panel design, including it in at least two 
         | consecutive waves. 
         |
         | Respondents coded 1 in E1009_P1 completed the CSES MODULE 5 
         | Questionnaire on two occasions (at different time points). In the
         | dataset, they are represented by two separate observations, 
         | the first classifying their responses at Time 1 (T1) and the  
         | second classifying their responses at Time 2 (T2). 
         | Respondents coded 0 in E1009_P1 did not complete the MODULE 5 
         | Questionnaire twice, even though they were part of a study which
         | had a panel component. Alternatively, it may classify
         | respondents recruited in studies combining respondents from 
         | multiple electoral cycles with freshly sampled individuals to the 
         | universe of already existing respondents.
         | Respondents coded 7 in E1009_P1 are part of regular cross-
         | sectional designs, which applies to the vast majority of studies
         | included in CSES.
         |
         | This variable facilitates researchers who wish to study intra-
         | respondent behavior (i.e., the behavior of a respondent at T1 and
         | T2). For more details on how to connect respondents interviewed 
         | on two occasions, and which are represented in the MODULE 5  
         | dataset as two separate observations, please consult 
         | variable E1009_P2 which classifies the respondent ID at T1 for 
         | respondents interviewed the second time (T2).

         | VARIABLE NOTES: E1009_P2
         |
         | E1009_P2 applies only to respondents who completed the MODULE 5
         | Questionnaire at least twice and at two different time points.
         | A CSES Module is often administered multiple times within one
         | polity but conventionally, it is administered on fresh cross-
         | sectional samples of the polity's population. 
         | However, in rare circumstances, the module has been administered 
         | multiple times to the same respondent at different time 
         | intervals. E1009_P1 classifies those respondents who have been
         | interviewed twice - i.e., respondents originating from studies
         | that administered CSES MODULE 5 in a panel design, including 
         | it in at least two consecutive waves.
         |          
         | Respondents that completed the MODULE 5 Questionnaire on two  
         | occasions (at different time points) are represented by two 
         | separate observations, the first classifying their responses
         | at Time 1 (T1) and the second classifying their responses at 
         | Time 2 (T2). E1009_P2 allows researchers to connect these two 
         | observations. It lists the respondent ID applied to the 
         | respondent at T1 for respondents interviewed at T2. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - UNITED STATES (2016): E1009_P2
         | 
         | All respondents that are represented both in the UNITED STATES 
         | 2016 and 2020 studies are assigned their respondent ID from the
         | 2016 study in E1009_P2. All respondents interviewed in 2016 only
         | are coded "99999999997. NOT APPLICABLE" in E1009_P2.
         | 
         | Furthermore, researchers are advised that the American National 
         | Election Study (ANES) 2016 Time Series includes two respondent 
         | identifiers: A respondent identifier assigned by ANES (variable
         | V160001 in the original dataset) and a respondent identifier 
         | assigned by the fieldwork agency Westat (variable V160001_orig 
         | in the original dataset). 
         | Variables E1009 and E1005 as included in CSES are coded based on 
         | V160001, the respondent identifier coded by ANES. However, as the
         | 2020 ANES data provided panel identifiers based on V160001_orig, 
         | the Westat identifier, only, E1009_P2 is coded based on 
         | V160001_orig for respondents re-interviewed in the ANES 2020.

         Original Weights provided by the national election study 
         ..................................................................

         | VARIABLE NOTES: E1010
         |
         | E1010_ details the original weights provided by each election
         | study in CSES MODULE 5. 
         |
         | Sample weights include those intended to correct for unequal
         | selection probabilities resulting from "booster" samples,
         | procedures for selection within the household, non-response,
         | as well as other features of the sample design.
         |
         | Demographic weights adjust sample distributions of socio-
         | demographic characteristics to more closely resemble the
         | characteristics of the population.
         |
         | Political weights reconcile discrepancies in the reported
         | electoral behavior of the survey respondents from the
         | official vote counts.
         |
         | In cases where a Collaborator provides a single weight that
         | is a combination of one or more of the three weight categories
         | (sample, demographic, and political), the weight is duplicated
         | in the two or more appropriate variables. Thus, analysts using
         | two or more of the weights simultaneously will need to account
         | for this duplication.
         |
         | Use of weights is at the discretion of the analyst based upon
         | the considerations of her/his individual research question.
         | We recommend that analysts familiarize themselves with the
         | weights, their components, and their methods of creation
         | before applying them.
         |
         | Additionally, analysts will want to keep in mind that these
         | weights are prepared to be election study weights, not country
         | weights. To convert the weights to country weights requires an
         | adjustment for those countries for which one or more polities
         | or election studies appear in the dataset.
         |
         | Where a weight of a particular type is unavailable, these
         | variables are coded 1.
         |
         | Collaborators provided the original weights with a varying
         | number of decimal places. In this CSES dataset, however, all
         | of the original weights have been rounded to four decimal
         | places at maximum (i.e. 1.1234) using STATA.
         |
         | Further details on the overall sampling design, including the 
         | weights deposited with CSES, are provided in the "Overview of 
         | Study Design and Weights" available for each election study in 
         | Part 6 of the CSES MODULE 5 Codebook. 
         | Additionally, users may consult the Design Reports for even more 
         | comprehensive information. Design Reports for each polity 
         | included in CSES are available on the CSES MODULE 5 Study Page at 
         | https://cses.org/data-download/cses-module-5-2016-2021/.
         |
         | In some instances, original weights as deposited with CSES 
         | included missing values or observations coded as zero. ELECTION
         | STUDY NOTES for E1010_ detail how the affected cases were handled

         | the British National Election Study because one or multiple of 
         | the variables used for the weight calculation were missing. 
         | These cases are assigned the mean value of the provided 
         | demographic weight.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ITALY (2018): E1010_3
         |
         | In the original deposited political weight (E1010_3), 671 
         | respondents were coded as system missing because there was no 
         | information available for them on lower house vote choice 
         | variables. After consulting with the Collaborator, these cases 
         | were recoded to zero such that they will drop out of any analyses
         | in which the weight is applied.  
         | Because the voting age differs between the lower house (18 years 
         | and older) and the upper house (25 years and older), applying
         | any of the three weights adjusts the data for the lower house 
         | electorate but not the upper house electorate.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - LITHUANIA (2020): E1010_2 & E1010_3
         |
         | The sample includes twelve respondents who are Lithuanian 
         | citizens and thus eligible voters, but reside abroad. For these
         | twelve observations, identified in variable E2020 (Region of 
         | Residence), weights could not be calculated. After consulting 
         | with the Collaborator, the out-of-country respondents were 
         | assigned the average values of the weight variables E1010_2 and 
         | E1010_3, respectively.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NETHERLANDS (2017): E1010_2 & E1010_3
         |
         | For 41 respondents in E1010_2 and 90 respondents in E1010_3, 
         | no weight value was provided because one or multiple of the 
         | variables used for calculating the weights were missing. 
         | For example, some respondents did not indicate their vote choice 
         | and a smaller number of respondents also had missing values on 
         | demographic variables such as country of origin.
         | The 41 cases in E1010_2 were assigned the mean value of the 
         | provided demographic weight.
         | Following other MODULE 5 studies, the 90 respondents in E1010_3
         | were recoded to 0 for the political weight variable and are
         | hence dropped from analyses upon applying E1010_3.

         |
         | E1011_ details the mean weight of each type, within each polity

         | E1012_3.
         |
         | To follow is the STATA code used to create variables

         | E1012_ details the standardized versions (with a mean 1 within 
         | the polity) of the original weights provided with the component
         | election studies, described in E1010. They are the ratio of each
         | weighting factor to the mean weight (E1011) of each type, 
         | calculated within each polity.
         |
         | The derivative "Polity Weight" (E1012) has been created so
         | that for each weight (sample, demographic, political), each
         | respondent within the election study has a mean weight of "1".
         | If you are running a frequency, for instance, this weight
         | will work so that the N in your frequency table comes out to
         | approximately the same as the number of interviews in the
         | study. This derivative weight is created by dividing the
         | individual weight for each respondent within an election
         | study by the mean for that weight for all respondents in that
         | election study.
         |

         |
         | E1013 details the ratio of the average sample size to each 
         | election study sample. This factor is calculated on the basis of
         | the samples appearing in the CSES data files (i.e. does not
         | incorporate booster samples, panel respondents who did not
         | participate in the CSES wave of multi-wave studies, etc.). 
         | Further, this factor treats elections, and not political systems,
         | as the unit of analysis. Analysts wishing to compare across-
         | countries, instead of across-election studies, should adjust this
         | weight accordingly.
         |
         | The resulting factor is then used to create the derivative
         | "Dataset Weights" in variables E1014_1 through E1014_3.

         | mixed electoral system. 71 of the 141 seats are elected in 
         | single-member constituencies, with the 70 remaining seats being 
         | elected in a nationwide constituency via party-list vote.

         |   paper are sometimes referenced as paper-and-pencil interviews
         |   (PAPI).
         | - Face-to-face in-person interviews using an electronic or
         |   computerized questionnaire are also known as computer-assisted
         |   personal interviews (CAPI). Sometimes, such interviews may 
         |   include self-administered components - for e.g. for questions 
         |   deemed sensitive. Self-administered parts interviewers give to 
         |   respondents as part of a face-to-face protocol are also known
         |   as computer-assisted self-interviewing (CASI).
         | - Telephone interviews are sometimes labeled computer-assisted 
         |   telephone interviews (CATI).
         | - Internet surveys are sometimes also referred to as computer- 
         |   assisted web interviews (CAWI) or computerized self-
         |   administered questionnaire (CSAQ).

         | E1025_1 refers to the main interview that was originally 
         | scheduled as face-to-face using an electronic questionnaire. 
         | When lockdown restrictions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic 
         | were implemented in Britain in spring 2020, the study adopted a 
         | mixed-mode approach, with a push-to-mail and push-to-Internet 
         | strategy. 
         | Some CSES questions were included in a supplementary, self-
         | completion questionnaire. E1025_2 refers to the mode of this 
         | supplementary questionnaire.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NETHERLANDS (2017): E1025_1 & E1025_2
         |
         | E1025_1 refers to the mode of the main questionnaire, while 
         | E1025_2 refers to the supplementary questionnaire.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NETHERLANDS (2021): E1025_1 & E1025_2
         |
         | As the Dutch 2021 study spread CSES-related questions throughout 
         | the pre- and post-election interview, E1025_1 refers to the mode
         | of the pre-election questionnaire, while E1025_2 refers to the 
         | post-election questionnaire. 
         | Wherever possible, the post-election survey was used for the CSES
         | variables. For variables in which this is not the case, there is
         | a reference in the Election Study Notes.
         |
         | For further details on the sampling design, users are advised to 
         | consult ELECTION STUDY NOTES for variable E1007 (Sampling 
         | component) and Codebook Part 6.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - UNITED STATES (2016): E1025_1
         |
         | As questions assessing the respondent's gender (E2001) and 
         | household income (E2010, E2011) were regarded as being sensitive,
         | respondents assigned to the face-to-face mode answered these 
         | questions privately. For these questions, the respondent used the
         | interviewer's computer while the interviewer stepped away, such
         | that the screen was out of the interviewer's view.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - UNITED STATES (2020): E1025_1
         |
         | In response to challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
         | 2020 American National Election Study implemented a contactless,
         | sequential mixed-mode design. Sampling components for the 2020
         | study correspond to the survey mode sequence employed.
         | For each respondent, E1025_1 provides the mode pre- and post-
         | election interviews were conducted in. The sampling components 
         | are detailed in variable E1007 (Sampling Component).

E1026        >>> SELF-SELECTION INTO MODE OF INTERVIEW
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Whether respondent self-selected or was assigned to interview mode. 
         ..................................................................

             0. NOT APPLICABLE

             1. RESPONDENTS SELF-SELECTED INTO MODE
             2. RESPONDENTS WERE ASSIGNED TO MODE, NO SELF-SELECTION

             9. MISSING


         | VARIABLE NOTES: E1026
         |
         | E1026 distinguishes between studies where respondents were 
         | assigned to the study mode and those studies where different 
         | characteristics of respondents led to de-facto self-selection 
         | into a survey mode. The variable operates on the study level
         | and is only applicable to mixed-mode studies. 
         |
         | Further details on the overall sampling design, including the 
         | mode(s) of interview used, are provided in the "Overview of Study
         | Design and Weights" available for each election study in Part 6
         | of the CSES MODULE 5 Codebook. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NETHERLANDS (2021): E1026
         |
         | The Dutch 2021 election study is comprised of two independent 
         | sampling components differentiated in variable E1007 (Sampling
         | Component). 
         | The 1,797 respondents sampled from the LISS panel were all 
         | interviewed online and could not self-select into a different 
         | mode. Hence, these respondents are coded 0. NOT APPLICABLE in
         | E1026. 
         | The 1,688 respondents freshly sampled from population registers 
         | were invited to participate in an Internet survey but could 
         | choose to fill in a mail-back questionnaire as an alternative. 
         | Hence, E1026 is coded 1. RESPONDENT SELF-SELECTED INTO MODE for 
         | them.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SWITZERLAND (2019): E1026
         |
         | All selected respondents were first invited to complete the 
         | survey via the Internet. With the second reminder (out of three),
         | a paper version of the questionnaire was sent to those who 
         | had not yet participated in the survey.
         | Thus, E1026 codes those respondents as "1. RESPONDENTS SELF-
         | SELECTED INTO MODE" who had not filled out the Internet survey
         | by the date of reception of the paper questionnaire. All 
         | respondents who filled out the online questionnaire ahead of 
         | the second reminder did not have the choice to fill in the 
         | paper version and are hence coded "2. RESPONDENTS WERE ASSIGNED
         | TO MODE, NO SELF-SELECTION" in E1026.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - UNITED STATES (2020): E1026
         |
         | Upon initial refusal or non-response, parts of the fresh 2020 
         | sample were shifted to a different mode. These groups are 
         | detailed in Codebook Part 6. However, since cases were randomly 
         | assigned to mode conditions and were shifted only upon refusal
         | or non-response, E1026 is coded "2. NO SELF-SELECTION" for the
         | U.S. 2020 study.

E1027        >>> DURATION OF INTERVIEW
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Duration of interview.
         ..................................................................

             001-500. NUMBER OF MINUTES

             99999.   MISSING


         | VARIABLE NOTES: E1027
         |
         | E1027 details the length of the interview in minutes. 
         |
         | For a small number of cases, the duration of interview exceeds
         | the limit as specified in the codes provided above. 
         | When probed, Collaborators report a range of potential reasons
         | for interview duration deviations including the following
         | technical issues:
         | - interviewers forgetting to exit the application used for data 
         |   collection upon completion of the interview
         | - respondents interrupting online interviews without closing the 
         |   associated application in their web browser, completing 
         |   the interview at a later time or day.
         | - other technical issues during the survey administration not 
         |   further specified.
         |
         | Data is mostly unavailable for studies that relied solely on 
         | self-completion mail-back studies or respondents that completed 
         | the survey using this mode; although in some instances, self-
         | estimates by the respondent are provided and are listed in the 
         | below ELECTION STUDY NOTES where appropriate. 
         |         
         | Data are unavailable for AUSTRALIA (2019), AUSTRIA (2017),
         | CHILE (2017), COSTA RICA (2018), FRANCE (2017), GREAT BRITAIN 
         | (2017 & 2019), ICELAND (2016 & 2017), IRELAND (2016), ISRAEL

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - DENMARK (2019): E1027
         |
         | The 140 respondents coded "99999. Missing" in E1027 interrupted 
         | the interview and finished it at a later date, making calculation
         | of interview duration infeasible.  

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2021): E1027
         |
         | For the German 2021 study, E1027 differs by mode of interview: 
         | For respondents interviewed online, E1027 includes the time the 
         | respondent spent filling out the questionnaire as provided by 
         | the survey institute. Respondents who filled in a self-
         | administered mail-back survey self-reported the time they
         | spent on the questionnaire.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GREECE (2019): E1027
         | 
         | For generating E1027 for the Greek 2019 study, Collaborators  
         | provide response times for CSES-related items only. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NORWAY (2017): E1027
         |
         | For some respondents, the start time and end time are on 
         | different dates. In these cases, the duration are set to  
         | "99999. Missing"

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SWITZERLAND (2019): E1027
         |
         | For the Switzerland (2019) study, this variable is only 
         | available for respondents who filled the questionnaire online.
         | The variable indicates the total amount of time (in minutes)
         | between the respondents' very first click when logging into the
         | online questionnaire to the very last click when submitting the
         | completed questionnaire.
         | Respondents were explicitly told that they do not have to fill
         | in the questionnaire in one go but could also take breaks and
         | resume the questionnaire later on. Swiss Collaborators also sent
         | specific reminders for those respondents that had already
         | started the questionnaire but not answered all the questions yet
         | to tell them that they can easily continue from where they last
         | stopped filling the questionnaire.
         | Respondents with unusually high values for the E1027 variable
         | (i.e., 200 minutes or more) are presumably those respondents who
         | did not fill in the questionnaire in one go but took breaks when
         | responding to the questions or resumed the questionnaire after a
         | few days/weeks when they were reminded that they had not finished
         | the whole questionnaire yet.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - TAIWAN (2016): E1027
         |
         | For a small number of cases, the interview time does not exceed
         | 15 minutes. The Collaborators note these are a result of 
         | technical difficulties during the interview, such as tablet
         | power failure or unexpected system shutdown. In these situations
         | interviewer shifted to a paper questionnaire to collect data and
         | then put in the collected data later in the system. These rare
         | occasions are the reason why the duration of the interview was
         | less than 15 minutes for some cases.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - UNITED STATES (2020): E1027
         |
         | For the U.S. 2020 study, interview length was calculated by 
         | question-level interview session and audit trail data. 
         | Collaborators note in some instances, the source data provided 
         | by the vendor did not contain complete records for all interview
         | cases, such that the interview length could be very short in some
         | cases. Specifically, there are several cases where the vendor's
         | system failed to record part of the interview  session timing 
         | data. 
         | Users are advised that missing question-level timing data could 
         | mean either that the respondent was intentionally not asked the 
         | question or that the system failed to record the timing of the 
         | variable due to a system error or similar. Further, an 
         | unrealistically short response time could have been recorded in 
         | certain branching questions by the data collection vendor's 
         | system reloading the survey screen. 
         | Hence, providing an estimate on the case-level of how many 
         | respondents are affected would be misleading. The portion of 
         | records that are incomplete varies - it might be one question 
         | missing, or many.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - FRANCE (2017): E1028
         | 
         | The survey institute conducting the French election study did 
         | not assign ID-codes to interviewers. Collaborators created
         | interviewer IDs ex-post by using the Primary Sampling Units 
         | (electoral districts for lower house elections) that were 
         | available in the original file. IDs were assigned if the 
         | variance of Interviewer experience was equal to 0 within a
         | PSU. Those for whom this was not the case were deemed missing 
         | (corresponding to four PSUs).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - UNITED STATES (2016): E1028
         |
         | The deposited dataset contained an interviewer ID variable in 
         | string format. Specifically, each interviewer ID started with 
         | the acronym "ANES", followed by a four-digit number.
         | For the CSES MODULE 5 dataset, only the digits from the original 
         | interviewer ID were kept. Furthermore, in case the four-digit 
         | code started with one or several zeros, these zeros were 
         | dropped. 
         | Recoding was realized in Stata 14.2 using the following commands:
         |
         | gen E1028a = V168301 
         | gen E1028b = substr(E1028a, 5, 8) ///

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - FINLAND (2019): E1032
         |
         | According to data available for the E1032 variable, the last
         | interview for the Finnish study was conducted in July 2019. 
         | However, after the data collection, it was realized that due to 
         | a programming error 288 respondents were not asked several items
         | from the questionnaire. These respondents were approached again
         | afterwards in the second round of data collection, which ended on
         | October 5, 2019.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GREAT BRITAIN (2017): E1032-E1034
         | 
         | The post-election interviewing started on June 26, 2017, but 
         | the first interview (E1032, E1033, E1034) was conducted on
         | June 28, 2017. Those dates differ because the start date 
         | originates from the whole British Election Survey sample but
         | the person interviewed on June 26, 2017, did not take the CSES 
         | Module.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GREAT BRITAIN (2019): E1032-E1034
         | 
         | The post-election interviewing started on December 21, 2019, but 
         | the first interview (E1032, E1033, E1034) was conducted on
         | December 28, 2019. Those dates differ because the start date 
         | originates from the whole British Election Survey sample but
         | the person interviewed on December 21, 2019, did not take the 
         | CSES Module.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - INDIA (2019): E1032-E1034
         | 
         | The 2019 Indian general elections were held in seven phases from 
         | April 11 to May 19, 2019. Hence, fieldwork started ahead of the 
         | last election phase. However, respondents living in one of the 
         | districts entitled to vote in phase seven were all interviewed 
         | after May 19. Hence, all interviews included in the Indian 2019 
         | dataset were conducted post-election. For further information on
         | the seven-phase electoral schedule, researchers are advised to 
         | consult ELECTION STUDY NOTES for variables E1016-E1018.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NETHERLANDS (2021): E1032-E1034
         | 
         | The Dutch 2021 study has a pre- and post-election panel design 
         | consisting of two distinct and independent sampling components: 
         | A fresh random register sample and a sample drawn from the 
         | an ongoing online panel (SEE ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NETHERLANDS 
         | (2017): E1007).
         | Both components were interviewed at least twice: Once before the 
         | election and once or twice after the election. Pre-election 
         | interviews were conducted between January 26 and March 14, 2021.
         | While the register sample completed the post-election interview 
         | without interruption, the questionnaire was split in two for 
         | LISS. E1032-E1034 report the end date of the post-election 
         | interview. For LISS panelists, this refers to the end of the 
         | second post-election interview round, i.e., the date on which 
         | LISS-panelists completed the whole questionnaire.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - UNITED STATES (2016): E1032-E1034
         |
         | The survey was administered between November 9, 2016, and
         | January 9, 2017. For demographic variables as well as for
         | respondents who had voted early, the CSES includes questions of 
         | the pre-election questionnaire, administered between 
         | September 7 and November 8, 2016.
         | Respondents were asked in the pre-election survey whether they
         | voted early. Respondents who affirmed this were asked the
         | questions about their voting behavior (E3012_PR_1-E3013_UH_DC)
         | already in the pre-election survey. All other respondents were
         | asked the questions about their voting behavior in the post-
         | election part of the survey. Early voters are indicated as
         | belonging to a different sample component in variable E1007.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - UNITED STATES (2020): E1032-E1034
         |
         | The post-election survey was administered between November 6, 
         | 2020, and January 3, 2021. For demographic variables as well as 
         | for respondents who had voted early, the CSES includes questions 
         | from the pre-election questionnaire, administered between 
         | August 18 and November 3, 2020.
         | Respondents were asked in the pre-election survey whether they
         | voted early. Respondents who affirmed this were asked the
         | questions about their voting behavior (E3012_PR_1-E3013_UH_DC)
         | already in the pre-election survey. All other respondents were

         | belonging to a different sample component in variable E1007.
         | E1032 - E1034 indicate the start date for each interview. 
         | 1,548 respondents (20.8% of post-election interviews) completed
         | the interview on a later date than the start date.

         |
         | Studies included in the CSES MODULE 5 fielded one of two

         | A pandemic is an epidemic of infectious disease that has spread
         | across a large region or multiple or worldwide and affecting a
         | substantial number of individuals.
         |                   
         | At the time of writing, COVID-19 was first discovered in November
         | 2019. However, it is possible human-to-human transmission of the
         | disease was occurring before this discovery. On January 11, 2020
         | the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified by Chinese
         | authorities of a virus outbreak in Wuhan, China. On January 30,
         | 2020, the World Health Organization classified COVID-19 as a 
         | Public Health Emergency of Concern before eventually declaring 
         | the Health situation as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
         |                 
         | An election (or election study) is classified as taking place
         | during the COVID-19 pandemic if the election itself took place
         | and/or the entire study fieldwork was administered on or after
         | March 11, 2020 to December 31, 2021, the end of the 
         | CSES MODULE 5 fieldwork. March 11, 2020 is the day on which
         | the World Health Organization (WHO) officially classified the
         | COVID-19 Health Crisis as a pandemic.
         | An election (or election study) is classified as taking place
         | entirely pre the COVID-19 pandemic if the election was held and
         | the election study fieldwork was completed before March 11, 2020. 
         | An election which took place before March 11, 2020 but in which
         | the fieldwork took place both before and/or after March 11, 2020
         | is classified as an election taking place both pre and during the
         | COVID-19 pandemic.

         |
         | E1039 details whether the CSES MODULE 5 Questionnaire was 
         | administered more than once in a polity or not.  
         | 
         | Conventionally, a CSES Module is intended to be administered 
         | during a consecutive period of five years. Given that most 
         | electoral cycles encompass a regular four to five year period, 
         | 35 out of 45 polities included in CSES MODULE 5 fielded the 
         | Questionnaire once. 
         |
         | However, in ten polities that experienced more than one election 
         | in the 2016-2021 MODULE 5 administration period, CSES MODULE 5 
         | was fielded twice. This applies to the following studies:
         | CZECHIA (2017 & 2021), GERMANY (2017 & 2021), GREAT BRITAIN 
         | (2017 & 2019), GREECE (2015 & 2019), ICELAND (2016 & 2017), 
         | LITHUANIA (2016 & 2020), NETHERLANDS (2017 & 2021), NEW ZEALAND 
         | (2017 & 2020), TAIWAN (2016 & 2020) and UNITED STATES 
         | (2016 & 2020).
         |
         | Researchers are advised that in rare circumstances, MODULE 5
         | has further been administered multiple times to the same 
         | respondent at different time intervals. These instances are 
         | detailed in variables E1009_P1 and E1009_P2.

         | The Albanian Election Study asked for age rather than 
         | Month/Year of birth. E2001_Y was approximated by subtracting 
         | respondents' age at the time of the interview from 2017, i.e., 
         | the election year.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRALIA (2019): E2001_Y
         |
         | Respondents were not asked their year and month of birth, but 
         | their age as of June 30, 2019. The variable represents the
         | calculated year of birth, using the year of the interview and
         | the age of the respondent. For persons whose birthday was
         | after the interview, the year of birth will hence be incorrect.

         | There is one respondent born in 2002, meaning that she was 17 at
         | the time of election and interview for the Finnish study, and
         | thus not eligible to vote nor to participate in the study. Data
         | remain unchanged in the dataset. Finnish Collaborators note this
         | is most likely a typo by the surveyor, and this respondent was
         | most likely born in 2001.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2021): E2001_Y
         |
         | For 64 respondents, the year of birth is missing. Collaborators 
         | note eligibility of the 64 individuals has been assessed before
         | the interview, and that data is coded missing because the 
         | respective respondents did not answer the question.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GREAT BRITAIN (2019): E2001_Y

         | Users are advised that the generational boundaries as described
         | above are primarily based on generational classifications
         | employed in advanced democracies. As generational experiences  
         | are in part determined by social, cultural, political and/or 
         | economic events that might be unique to a polity, users are 
         | advised that generational classifications may differ in 
         | particular polities and these classifications, based on theory, 
         | merely act as a guide. 
         | 
         | Respondents were asked to provide their year of birth directly
         | (variable E2001_Y). Hence, E2001_Y forms the basis for the 
         | grouping.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2017 & 2021): E2003
         |
         | For both German studies, Collaborators assigned ISCED codes 
         | based on two survey questions, one covering general schooling 
         | and the other one covering vocational training. 
         | In two instances, the survey instruments used by the German 
         | Election Study allowed a match to more than one ISCED level. 
         | Specifically, respondents with a master craftsman's or a 
         | technician's diploma were coded  to ISCED level 6, although they 
         | might have been coded into ISCED level 5. Likewise, respondents 
         | without a school diploma or lower secondary schooling who 
         | obtained a vocational school diploma (Berufsfachschule) were 
         | coded into ISCED level 3, although they could have also been 
         | coded into ISCED level 4. 
         | Respondents who were still attending school at the time of the 
         | interview were coded as missing, as were respondents who stated 
         | to have a school or vocational training diploma other than those 
         | specified in the given answer categories. 
         |
         | In the German 2021 study, respondents answering the paper-and-
         | pencil questionnaire were not asked to differentiate between 
         | different academic degrees (ISCED levels 6 to 8), but were asked 
         | whether they obtained a university degree more generally 
         | instead. As the only available information from the mail-back 
         | survey component was the attainment of a university degree in 
         | general, the respective respondents were coded as "07. ISCED 
         | LEVEL 6 - BACHELOR OR EQUIVALENT".

         |
         | For respondents from the Dutch 2021 study, this variable is from 
         | the pre-election survey.
         |
         | After consultation with Collaborators, respondents with an MBO 
         | degree were classified as "ISCED LEVEL 4 - POST-SECONDARY 
         | NON-TERTIARY". Collaborators note that a completed secondary 
         | education is an entry requirement for MBO programs. 
         | Further, respondents with an HBO degree were coded as "ISCED 
         | LEVEL 6 - BACHELOR OR EQUIVALENT". HBOs resemble universities 
         | of applied science, and they award bachelor's degrees as a 
         | diploma.

         |
         | For New Zealand 2017, Collaborators assigned ISCED codes based 
         | on two survey questions, one covering the highest secondary 
         | school qualification and the other one covering any post-
         | secondary school qualifications. 
         | In one instance, the survey instruments used by the New Zealand 
         | Election Study allowed a match to more than one ISCED level. 
         | Specifically, respondents with a tertiary degree at institute, 
         | polytechnic or Wananga were coded to ISCED level 5, although 
         | they might have been coded into ISCED level 6.

         | In the 2017 French election study, the marital status of 
         | respondents was assessed with three survey questions.
         | The first asked whether respondents were living together with a
         | partner. 
         | Respondents living with a partner were asked about the 
         | legal status of their relationship in a follow-up question
         | (married, civil union, cohabiting, divorced). 
         | Respondents not living with a partner received a separate 
         | follow-up question detailing their marital status (married, 
         | civil union, divorced/separated, widowed, single).

         | The question wording for E2004 deviates from the CSES MODULE 5 
         | standards. The question asked respondents whether they were 
         | currently living with a spouse or partner (coded as 1) or not 
         | (coded as 2). In the CSES, respondents who answered "Yes" were 
         | recoded into "1. MARRIED OR LIVING TOGETHER AS MARRIED". 
         | Respondents who answered "No" were recoded into "5. [SEE ELECTION

         | were widowed, divorced or separated, or single or never married.

         | Respondents who are temporarily unemployed are coded UNEMPLOYED.
         | Respondents on "workfare" or enrolled in a government job 
         | training program are coded EMPLOYED.
         |
         | There is some inconsistency between studies in the way
         | the responses to the questions about current employment status
         | (E2006) affected the application of the follow-up occupation
         | variables (E2007-E2009). The CSES standard is that the
         | occupation variables are asked from those in labor force.
         | However, in some cases, for respondents categorized as not in
         | labor force in E2006 (codes 6-12) the occupation variables may
         | report respondent's last occupation. Hence, the responses
         | concerning occupation that belong to respondents not in labor
         | force presumably reflect their previous or last occupation.

         |
         | In the Dutch 2017 study, respondents' employment status was 
         | assessed by several successive survey questions. 
         | Respondents were first asked if they currently had a paid job. 
         | Respondents stating to have a paid job were then asked to 
         | indicate the number of their weekly working hours, excluding 
         | unpaid overtime. Respondents without a paid job at the time
         | of the interview were asked to provide further details on their
         | current situation. 
         | The answers to these two questions were used to code E2006, as 
         | shown below:

         |        13.     Paid job, number of working hours unknown
         |
         | Further, respondents stating to have a paid job but refusing to 
         | name their weekly working hours were asked to group their 
         | working hours in one of four broad categories, that have been 
         | recoded as follows (N = 14):

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NETHERLANDS (2021): E2006
         |
         | This variable is from the pre-election survey.
         |
         | In the Dutch 2021 study, respondents' employment status was 
         | assessed by several successive survey questions. All items were
         | included in the pre-election survey.
         |
         | Respondents were first asked what their main activity (i.e., 
         | employment status) was. Afterward, respondents were asked 
         | whether they currently had a paid job. In a follow-up question, 
         | respondents stating to have a paid job indicated the number of 
         | their weekly working hours, excluding unpaid overtime. 
         | 
         | The answers to these two questions were used to code E2006, as 
         | shown below:
         |
         | CSES Code      Election Study Code/Category
         |----------------------------------------------------------------
         |         1.     Paid job, more than 32 working hours
         |         2.     Paid job, 15 - 32 working hours
         |         3.     Paid job, less than 15 working hours
         |         5.     Unemployed; 
         |                No paid job
         |         6.     Study/school
         |         7.     (Pre-)pension
         |         8.     Housekeeping/childcare
         |         9.     Illness/disability
         |        10.     Other 
         |        12.     Volunteer work        
         |        13.     Paid job, number of working hours unknown
         |
         | Further, respondents stating to have a paid job but refusing to 
         | name their weekly working hours were asked to group their 
         | working hours in one of four broad categories that have been 
         | recoded as follows (N = 55): 
         |
         | CSES Code      Election Study Code/Category
         |----------------------------------------------------------------
         |         1.     Paid job, 30 hours a week or more
         |         2.     Paid job, less than 30 hours
         |         3.     Paid job, less than 12 hours
         |                Paid job, less than 4 hours
         |
         | Finally, some respondents gave inconsistent answers across 
         | questions. For example, some respondents stated to have a job
         | and gave their weekly working hours, although they grouped
         | themselves to be out of the labor force (codes 5 to 10 in 
         | E2006). For these respondents, their out-of-the-labor force 
         | status was coded for E2006. Another group of respondents stated 
         | that paid work was their main activity but specified not to 
         | have a paid job in the follow-up question. The first answer 
         | (main activity) was coded for CSES.

         |
         | As the Swedish 2018 study consists of web and postal interviews,
         | respondents could mark multiple answers. Collaborators classified
         | these answers into one single variable, which was used for coding
         | E2006. Following their suggestion, students, pensioners and 
         | respondents on sickness/activity compensation working for pay 
         | were classified as students, pensioners, and being permanently
         | disabled, respectively. 
         | Further, respondents were asked about their weekly working hours 
         | in a separate survey question. Answers to this follow-up 
         | question were used for specifying working hours of those in the 
         | labor force.

         | Coding for E2006 is based on the respondents' initial employment

         | The original ANES dataset includes an additional category for
         | temporary unemployment (code 13).

         | indicate their weekly working hours. These respondents were

         | Some of the respondents who are coded as unemployed, retired,

         | VARIABLE NOTES: E2007
         |
         | E2007 details the respondent's main occupation; that is, the job
         | at which the respondent spends the most time or if the respondent
         | spends an equal amount of time on two jobs, it is the one from
         | which the respondent earns the most money.
         | For respondents who are currently employed, this variable reports
         | their current occupation. For respondents who are retired or not
         | currently working, E2007 reports respondent's last occupation.
         |
         | Coding conventions employ the first two digits of 2008
         | ISCO / ILO International Standard Classification of Occupations
         | Code from the International Labor Office, CH-1211, Geneva 22,
         | Switzerland.

         | In some cases, it has not been possible to strictly adhere to the
         | two-digit ISCO/ILO conventions. Users will find that some 
         | categories have been added to the ISCO/ILO list in order to
         | accommodate the occupations of respondents who were not easily 
         | classified. These include categories referring to the first digit
         | of the 2008 ISCO / ILO occupations code. In these cases, zeros
         | were added to preserve the two-digit structure (e.g.,

         | Respondents' main occupation was assessed with two consecutive 
         | survey questions. Respondents were first asked to provide their 
         | occupation based on two-digit ISCO08 codes. In a follow-up 
         | question, respondents were requested to name their occupation 
         | based on more fine-grained ISCO08 3-digit codes. Both questions
         | included an open-ended "Other" option, allowing respondents to
         | provide further details on their occupation. Where possible, 
         | Collaborators assigned open-ended answers manually to ISCO 
         | codes. Respondents providing no or insufficient information 
         | for classification (e.g., "I work in the public sector") were 
         | coded to "996. OTHER NON-CLASSIFIABLE OCCUPATIONS".

         |
         | The occupation of respondents was asked using a series of 
         | four questions. These were, in order they were asked in the
         | original questionnaire:
         | 1. What is/was the name of the work (position) that you
         | carry/carried out (at the main workplace)? (Open-ended question)
         | 2. What is the sector of activity in which you work/have worked?
         | (Close-ended question)
         | 3. So, we can say that your occupation is/was...? (Close-ended
         | question, using ISCO two-digit codes)
         | 4. What kind of activity do you do/did you do at this job most of
         | the time? (Open-ended question)
         |
         | From these four questions, coders later retrieved new ISCO two
         | digit codes for the occupation of each respondent. Collaborators
         | noted several corrections to the coding of ISCO codes were made
         | using all the available information.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SLOVAKIA (2020): E2007
         |
         | In the original Slovakian study, respondents' main occupation

         | - Area/Field
         | - Content of your job (describe what you are doing in your job)
         |
         | These questions were recoded by Collaborators into a single item
         | for respondents' occupation, coded based on ISCO. In so doing,
         | Collaborators created a joint code for non-classifiable

         |
         | In the 2016 American National Election Study, respondents' main

         | by the 2010 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system. 
         | SOC codes were translated to ISCO 08 with a correspondence 
         | table provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which can

         | (Date last accessed: March 17, 2019). 
         | As SOC codes do not translate well into ISCO 08 codes, only 35 
         | out of 97 SOC-categories could be recoded to ISCO 08. 
         | Therefore, E2007 is available for 830 respondents only.

         | VARIABLE NOTES: E2008
         |
         | The categories provided in E2008 are intended to distinguish 
         | among the following groups:
         |
         | 1. White Collar:
         | Broad occupational grouping of workers engaged in non-manual
         | labor: Managers, salaried professionals, office workers,
         | sales personnel, and proprietors are generally included in
         | the category.
         |
         | 2. Worker:
         | Broad occupational grouping of workers engaged in manual labor.
         |
         | 3. Farmer:
         | Normally persons self-employed in farming.
         |
         | 4. Self-Employed:
         | Self-employed occupations of all kinds, excluding self-employed
         | farming. Includes, for example entrepreneurs, shop keeper,
         | professionals like lawyers, medical doctors etc.
         |
         | This variable was not part of the CSES MODULE 5 pilot 
         | questionnaire.
         |
         | There is some inconsistency between studies in the way
         | the responses to the questions about current employment status
         | (E2006) affected the application of the follow-up occupation
         | variables (E2008, E2009). The CSES standard is that the
         | occupation variables are asked from those in the labor force.
         | However, in some cases, for respondents categorized as not in
         | the labor force in E2006 (codes 6-12) the occupation variables
         | may report respondent's last occupation. Hence, the responses
         | concerning occupation that belong to respondents not in the
         | labor force presumably reflect their previous or last
         | occupation.
         |

         | The deposited 2018 Mexican study also includes a socio-economic 
         | status measure based on the standardized Niveles Socio 
         | Economicos index (NSE), classifying respondents into seven 
         | levels based on the most important household needs. As this 
         | index was challenging to translate to the CSES coding scheme, it 
         | was not used for coding E2008. Researchers interested in the 
         | NSE measure are hence referred to the source dataset.
         |
         | 77 respondents provided their socio economic status, although 
         | they were out of the labor force according to E2006. 
         | Collaborators note some of these discrepancies might result from
         | "informal jobs", i.e., productive activities not formally 
         | recorded (most notably homemakers selling some food or products 
         | in an informal setting, but classifying themselves as business

         | There is some inconsistency between studies in the way the
         | responses to the questions about current employment status 
         | (E2006) affected the application of the follow-up occupation
         | variables (E2008, E2009). The CSES standard is that the
         | occupation variables are asked from those in the labor force.
         | However, in some cases, for respondents categorized as not in
         | the labor force in E2006 (codes 6-12) the occupation variables
         | may report respondent's last occupation. Hence, the responses
         | concerning occupation that belong to respondents not in the
         | labor force presumably reflect their previous or last occupation.

         | to sample proportions (not national statistics). For cases where
         | it was not possible to compute sample quintiles, the income 
         | categories approximating sample quintiles the closest have been
         | used. Consequently, this variable may contain distributions that
         | do not really represent quintiles.
         |
         | Depending on how the income data was deposited, the variable 
         | reports either monthly or annual income. The table below shows 
         | which of the two applies to the election studies:

         | In the Mexican election study, Collaborators asked respondents to
         | name their monthly household income twice: Once in an open-ended
         | question, and once in a follow-up question, asking them to place
         | their income in one of seven income brackets. 
         | Income quintiles provided in E2010 are based on the 734 
         | respondents who provided continuous data.
         | For the additional 157 respondents for whom only categorical 
         | data is available, data were imputed by using the midpoint of 
         | their stated income category. For example, a respondent stating 
         | to have a monthly household income between 0 and 2,650 MXN
         | is assumed to have a household income of 1,325 MXN - thus 
         | falling into the first quintile.

         | Respondents were asked to indicate their average monthly net 
         | income. As the original survey question is composed of five
         | income brackets, E2010 equals E2011 (Household Income: Original

         | In the 2018 Turkish election study, Collaborators asked 
         | respondents to name their monthly household income in an open 
         | question. However, 60 respondents refusing to name their 
         | income received a follow-up question, asking them to place their
         | income in one of fifteen categories. 
         | Income quintiles provided in E2010 are based on the continuous
         | data. For the 60 respondents for whom continuous data is not 
         | available, data were imputed by using the midpoint of their 
         | stated income category. For example, a respondent stating to 
         | have a monthly household income between 1.501 and 2.000 TRY
         | is assumed to have a household income of 1.750 TRY - thus 
         | falling into the second quintile.

         | Respondents were asked two questions with respect to household 
         | income. First, they were asked in an open-ended question what
         | their annual household income was before taxes. If respondents 
         | refused to answer, they were asked in a follow-up question to 
         | place themselves in one of ten income brackets provided in the 
         | questionnaire. For CSES, respondents who provided an answer to
         | the open-ended income question were recoded to match the income 
         | brackets in the follow-up question.

         | Where available, the continuous measure was used for coding 
         | E2011 (N = 734). 
         | An additional 157 respondents placed themselves in one of the

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NETHERLANDS (2017): E2011
         |
         | For the Dutch 2017 study, income measures differ considerably
         | between the two sampling components, that is, the face-to-face
         | sample drawn from population registers (N = 723) and the sample
         | drawn from the ongoing "LISS" online panel (N = 1,180).
         | In what follows, data generation processes are described
         | separately for each component. Researchers interested in
         | differentiating between sample components are referred to
         | variable E1007 (Sampling Component) for further information.
         |
         | Data in E2011 for the face-to-face component have not been
         | collected in the survey but were obtained from population
         | registers. Respondents provided consent before data collection.
         | Generally, register data are based on the most recent available
         | data, usually the year preceding data collection.
         |
         | Further, the vendor split register data into quintiles,
         | which are coded as follows in E2011:
         |
         | CSES Code      Election Study Code/Category
         |----------------------------------------------------------------
         |        01.      Lowest Household Income Quintile ( 0- 20%)
         |        02.      Second Household Income Quintile (21- 40%)
         |        03.       Third Household Income Quintile (41- 60%)
         |        04.      Fourth Household Income Quintile (61- 80%)
         |        05.     Highest Household Income Quintile (81-100%)
         |
         | As the cutoff values for the above scale remain unknown, data
         | have not been transferred to E2010.
         |
         | Data for the online-panel component are based on survey
         | responses from the LISS-Panel. For this purpose, respondents
         | were asked to report their gross household income in EUR on
         | a continuous scale. If gross income was missing but net income
         | was reported to LISS, E2011 was imputed based on the group that
         | reported both gross and net income, and for whom both were non-
         | zero and non-bracketed. For respondents who only provided
         | bracketed net income information, LISS imputed the midpoint
         | value of the bracket. The imputed values have been rounded. 
         | For a small percentage of the respondents, both gross and net
         | income were unavailable. In these cases, no imputation was done.

         | Further, researchers are advised that the income measures differ 
         | considerably between the two sampling components, that is, the 
         | fresh 2021 sample drawn from population registers (N = 1,688) 
         | and the sample drawn from the ongoing "LISS" online panel 
         | (N = 1,797).
         |
         | Data for the fresh 2021 sample are based on a survey question
         | asking respondents to place their monthly net household income 
         | into one of the following 15 income brackets:

         | respondents from the register sample.
         | 
         | Data for the online-panel component are based on survey
         | responses from the LISS-Panel. For this purpose, respondents
         | were asked to report their absolute net household income in EUR 
         | on a continuous scale. Collaborators grouped the continuous 
         | variable into the 15 categories outlined above to obtain a 
         | common combined income measure across the two sample components.

         | respondents' personal and household income. Respondents living 
         | in single-member households were not asked about their household
         | income, as their household income is assumed to be equal to their
         | personal income. Hence, for these respondents from single-member 
         | households, E2011 includes data originating from the personal 
         | income question.

         | named the number of children living in their household in the 
         | pre-election interview. Both variables were added to create

         | topcoded at "8. eight or more people", the number of children
         | was topcoded at "9. More than eight children." That applies to 
         | the following four respondents:

         | Two answer categories for E2014 offered to respondents deviated 
         | slightly from CSES MODULE 5 standards. The CSES convention 
         | differentiates between the two categories "4. Once a month" and
         | "5. Two or more times a month". In the Uruguayan election study,
         | both categories were combined into "4. Once or more times a 
         | month" (see below).

         |
         | For the Indian 2019 study, E2016 reports respondents' caste
         | group rather than ethnicity. The four groups coded in E2016 
         | reflect one of the official classifications of the population of 
         | India used by public authorities, differentiating socio-economic
         | segments in the Indian society.
         | Further, Collaborators advise caste is arguably the most 
         | important variable in Indian elections. At every stage, politics 
         | is organized around caste identities - from local interest 
         | groups to leaders to factions within parties to parties. Caste 
         | is also a complex identity, drawing from ancient ideas of 
         | ethnicity, and the 'Varna system', which organized society into 
         | occupational groups.
         | 
         | Additionally, Collaborators report the following characteristics 
         | of caste groups:
         | 1. Scheduled Castes (also referred to as Dalits) constitute
         |    the former "untouchables", forming the lowest strata of the
         |    traditional Indian society.
         | 2. Scheduled Tribes refer to India's aboriginal population. They 
         |    include nomadic communities or communities living in forest 
         |    areas and are concentrated mainly in central and north-
         |    eastern India.
         | 3. Other Backward Classes form the majority of the population in 
         |    most if not all Indian states. As such, OBC is a heterogeneous
         |    category in terms of social status. Collaborators note albeit
         |    not voting uniformly, most states have dominant OBC castes 
         |    covering a substantial amount of votes.
         | 4. General Category refers to the upper castes, i.e., the 
         |    traditional elites or privileged sections of society who 
         |    enjoyed "ritual" privileges of education and social status, 
         |    although not necessarily wealth.

         | In the Dutch 2017 and 2021 studies, data on respondents' region 
         | of residence has not been collected in the survey but was 
         | obtained from population registers. Respondents provided consent 
         | before data collection.
         | Generally, register data are based on the most recent available 
         | data, usually the year preceding data collection. 
         |
         | The Dutch 2021 election study is comprised of two independent 
         | sampling components: a simple random sample drawn from 
         | population registers self-administered either online or via 
         | mail-back, and a sample drawn from the ongoing "LISS" online 
         | panel. For the 2021 study, data in E2020 are available for 
         | respondents from the first sampling component (register sample) 
         | only.

         | For the Tunisian 2019 election study, the regions of residence 
         | are almost identical to the primary electoral districts (E2021). 
         | The only difference is that the governorates Tunis, Nabeul and
         | Sfax are subdivided into Tunis 1 and Tunis 2, Nabeul 1 and 
         | Nabeul 2, and Sfax 1 and Sfax 2 in the primary electoral 
         | districts (E2021).

         | E2020 reports the federal state a respondent is living in,
         | according to US-FIPS codes.
         | District data for CSES MODULE 5 were collected for the U.S.
         | Presidential Elections, i.e., the main elections. The United 
         | States use an electoral college system for Presidential

         | to use E2020 for linking district data provided in variables
         | E4001 - E4007 to individual respondents, as E2020 corresponds
         | to the U.S. states.

         | For the Uruguayan 2019 election study, the region of residence 
         | categories are the same as the primary electoral district 
         | categories (E2021). However, as people can register in 
         | departments other than their place of residence, E2020 and E2021 
         | can show slight deviations in their distributions.

         | VARIABLE NOTES: E2021
         |
         | E2021 details respondents' primary electoral districts, using 
         | official district identification numbers wherever possible. 
         | Deviances from this CSES convention are detailed when applicable
         | in the ELECTION STUDY NOTES. 
         |
         | In some cases, not all districts in a polity are sampled by
         | the election study. More specific information regarding this
         | is detailed in the tables in the District Data section of the
         | Codebook. 
         |
         | In some cases, respondents' electoral districts were identified
         | "indirectly," through postal codes, etc., by the CSES Secretariat
         | (always with the help of the appropriate Collaborator(s)). Where
         | postal codes, etc., were ambiguous, cases are coded missing. 
         | Refusals and "don't know" are coded missing.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRIA (2017): E2021
         |
         | The data represents the first electoral tier (Regionalwahlkreis).
         | Seats in Austria are distributed across three tiers 
         | (Regionalwahlkreis-tier 1; Landwahlkreis-tier 2; and the  
         | federal level-tier 3).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BELGIUM-FLANDERS (2019): E2021
         |
         | Respondents were not asked to provide their electoral district 
         | in the survey. Instead, E2021 was coded based on the National  
         | Register used for sampling. However, due to privacy regulations,
         | Collaborators were neither granted access to respondents' 
         | addresses, nor allowed to ask respondents for full (four-digit) 
         | postal codes. Therefore, the National Register was provided with
         | envelopes including the survey, mailing them on Collaborators' 
         | behalf. 
         | By design, the National Register was instructed to mail only
         | Dutch-language questionnaires out to respondents with addresses  
         | in Flanders. Although some interviewees reported two-digit postal 
         | codes belonging to Brussels (not sampled) or Wallonia, 
         | Collaborators relied on the language of the questionnaire to 
         | divide respondents into regions, as that information was regarded
         | as more reliable than self-reports from survey answers. However,
         | the number of cases that do not adhere to this strict logic is 
         | minimal.

         | By design, the National Register was instructed to mail only

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - FINLAND (2019): E2021
         |
         | The primary electoral district identifier was not asked in the
         | survey. The data for E2021 were derived from municipality codes.
         | The original municipality variable was removed from the data 
         | because of confidentiality issues.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - HONG KONG (2016): E2021
         |
         | As interviews were conducted via telephone, respondents were 
         | asked to name their electoral district in a survey question. 
         | However, only respondents who said to have voted in the 2016 
         | geographical constituency elections for the Legislative Council
         | were requested to name their district (E3012_LH). Therefore, 
         | those respondents who either claimed not to have voted or who 
         | refused to answer to E3012_LH were coded missing in E2021 
         | (N = 132). 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NEW ZEALAND (2020): E2021
         | 
         | The size of New Zealand's electorates is determined such that 
         | all electorates have approximately the same population. The 
         | number of electorates increases at regular intervals in line 
         | with national population growth. Beginning with the 2020 general 
         | election, the number of electorates increased from 71 to 72. 
         | Thus, the number of primary electoral districts varies between 
         | 2017 and 2020. Apart from the additional electoral district, 
         | some electorates have been renamed by the Representation 
         | Commission, which determines the names of each electorate 
         | following the most recent census.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SWEDEN (2018): E2021
         |
         | Sweden has two electoral segments: The lower tier returns 310 
         | seats from 29 multi-member districts, the upper tier consists of 
         | 39 adjustment seats. District data on the number of seats
         | per district (E4001) and the number of seats won by PARTY A-I
         | in each district (E4005_A-I) refer to the lower tier.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - TUNISIA (2019): E2021
         |
         | The Tunisian parliament consists of 217 seats. 27 constituencies 
         | are based on the governorates of Tunisia. However, there are six 
         | additional overseas constituencies representing Tunisians abroad 
         | and electing 18 of those 217 seats. These overseas constituencies 
         | are located in Europe, America and Arabia. The Tunisian election
         | study solely consists of the constituencies located in Tunisia. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - UNITED STATES (2016 & 2020): E2021
         | 
         | This variable reports the electoral districts for the U.S. Lower
         | House elections, the House of Representatives. The first two
         | digits of the district codes indicate the federal state (U.S.-
         | FIPS-codes as used in E2020).
         | However, the district data for CSES MODULE 5 were collected for 
         | the U.S. Presidential Elections, i.e., the main elections.
         | Considering that the United States uses an electoral college 
         | system for Presidential elections that operates on the U.S.
         | state level, the data was collected accordingly. Hence, to link 
         | district data to respondents in the CSES dataset, users are 
         | advised to make use of the variable E2020 (Region of Residence) 
         | which corresponds to the U.S. states.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - URUGUAY (2019): E2021
         |  
         | The Lower Chamber (Camara de Representantes; House of
         | Representatives) of the Uruguayan General Assembly consists 
         | of 99 members. Seats are assigned between parties in a single
         | nationwide district, based on a proportional (d'Hondt) system. 
         | The system uses closed lists and Double Simultaneous Vote (DSV)
         | in regional districts. 
         | The 19 districts classified in variable E2021 matter for the 
         | distribution of seats within each party, as parties may compete
         | with different lists within regions.

         | The 2019 Canadian election study asked respondents to rate 
         | their political interest on an 11-point scale. Hence, the answer
         | categories offered to respondents deviated from CSES MODULE 5 
         | standards with response options ranging from 1 to 4. The 11-point 
         | scale runs from "0. No interest at all" to "10. A great deal of 
         | interest". The categories were assigned as listed below. Please 
         | note that the middle category 5 was assigned to "3. NOT VERY 
         | INTERESTED". The decision is based on the comparison of 
         | distributions between the Canadian political interest variable 
         | and the political interest variable of other MODULE 5 election 
         | studies.

         |
         | The answer categories for E3001 offered to respondent deviated  
         | from CSES MODULE 5 standards. The German election studies asked 
         | respondents to rate their interest in politics on a 5-point 
         | scale, additionally differentiating between a "very strong" and 
         | "strong" interest in politics. To match the CSES 4-point scale, 
         | these two original categories were collapsed into the CSES code 1
         | ("VERY INTERESTED"). The remaining categories were assigned as 
         | listed below. According to Collaborators, the resulting 
         | distribution is overall consistent with those seen in other 
         | studies that have used the 4-point scale in Germany (e.g.,

         | all respondents into consideration who answered at least to one 
         | of the four items. Respondents with a mean value of 1.5,
         | 2.5 or 3.5 were rounded downwards since the lowest value (1)
         | indicates the most attention to politics in the media and the
         | highest value (4) indicates the least attention.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SWITZERLAND (2019): E3002
         |
         | Respondents in the Swiss study were not asked one single
         | question about attention to politics across different media
         | sources. Instead, six questions were used to cover the following
         | media separately:
         | - TV
         | - Newspapers (print or e-paper)
         | - Free newspapers (print or e-paper)
         | - Social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter)
         | - Online news sites (e.g., watson.ch, srf.ch, 20min.ch)
         | - Radio
         | The answer scales for the six items were 4-point Likert scales
         | and respondents had to indicate for each item whether they are
         | "very attentive", "rather attentive", "rather not attentive", or
         | "not at all attentive" to each media item.
         | The variable E3002 was thus constructed by calculating the mean
         | of these six questions. For the E3002 variable, Collaborators
         | took everyone into consideration who answered at least one of 
         | the six items, i.e., mean values were calculated for all 
         | respondents. Respondents who had a mean value of 1.5, 2.5 or 3.5
         | were rounded downwards since the lowest value (1) indicates the 
         | most attention to politics in the media and the highest value (4)
         | indicates the least attention.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BELGIUM-FLANDERS (2019): E3006_3
         |
         | This item was asked in the Belgium-Flanders questionnaire as: "to
         | speak Dutch, French, or German" - i.e., referring to the three
         | official languages in Belgium, and using "or" to indicate any
         | of the languages.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BELGIUM-WALLONIA (2019): E3006_3
         |
         | This item was asked in the Belgium-Wallonia questionnaire as: "to
         | speak Dutch, French, or German" - i.e., referring to the three
         | official languages in Belgium, and using "or" to indicate any
         | of the languages.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - COSTA RICA (2018): E3006_2
         |
         | The questionnaire contained two items regarding the  
         | importance of ancestry. To be a true Costa Rican, it is 
         | important (1) for one's grandparents to have been born in       
         | Costa Rica, and (2) to have Costa Rican ancestry. The coding of
         | E3006_2 relies on the ancestry version (2) of the question.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - HONG KONG (2016): E3006_
         |
         | Before answering to E3006_, respondents were asked whether 
         | they identified as Chinese. Only respondents who affirmed 
         | to regard themselves as Chinese were asked E3006_. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - MEXICO (2018): E3006_
         | 
         | The answer categories for E3006_ offered to respondents deviated 
         | from CSES MODULE 5 standards. Instead of employing the four-point
         | scale envisaged by CSES, the study includes a five-point scale 
         | for all E3006_ variables. Collaborators note the middle category 
         | "of average importance" ("regular de importante") results from 
         | spontaneous responses, with 20-25% of participants preferring 
         | this option. For CSES, data were recoded as follows: 
         | 
         | CSES Code      Election Study Code/Category

         |        01.     Very important ("Muy importante")
         |        02.     Somewhat important ("Algo importante")
         |        03.     Not very important ("Poco importante")
         |        04.     Not important at all ("Nada importante")
         |        06.     Of average importance ("Regular de importante") 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - MONTENEGRO (2016): E3006_
         |
         | E3006_ refers to Montenegrin nationality. Collaborators report 
         | translating E3006_ to the Montenegrin context was challenging 
         | because the main political cleavage in Montenegro is "pro-
         | Montenegrin" vs. "pro-Serbian". Thus, asking respondents what is
         | important for being truly Montenegrin might have alienated parts
         | of the population who do not identify as Montenegrin (at least 
         | 30% of the population). 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NEW ZEALAND (2017): E3006_2
         |
         | The questionnaire contained two items regarding the  
         | importance of ancestry. To be a true New Zealander, it is
         | important (1) for one's grandparents to have been born in       
         | New Zealand, and (2) to have Maori ancestry. The coding of
         | E3006_2 relies on the grandparent version (1) of the question.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - POLAND (2019): E3006_6_PT & E3006_7_PT
         |
         | The Polish 2019 election study used the final version of the 
         | CSES MODULE 5 questionnaire. However, the study did also ask two 
         | national identity items (E3006_6_PT & E3006_7_PT) from the pilot
         | version of the questionnaire. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SOUTH KOREA (2016): E3006_6_PT
         |
         | E3006_6_PT was not part of the South Korean questionnaire
         | because according to Collaborators, there is no dominant 
         | religion in South Korea. Instead, several religions are
         | evenly spread among the population.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - TAIWAN (2016): E3006_3 & E3006_6_PT
         |
         | For E3006_3, respondents were asked about multiple languages
         | (Chinese, Taiwanese, Hakka, or aboriginal languages). For 
         | E3006_6_PT, respondents were asked about "the country's dominant
         | religion" without further specification and reference to any
         | particular religion. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - TAIWAN (2020): E3006_3

         |
         | For some variables in the Thai 2019 election study, such as 
         | E3007, an unusually high share of respondents did not provide 
         | substantive answers (> 20% of data coded refused, don't know, or 
         | missing). Collaborators note two potential reasons for this 
         | peculiarity:
         |
         | At the time of the election, Thailand's incumbent Prime 
         | Minister was Prayut Chan-o-cha, leader of the State Power Party 
         | (PPRP, PARTY A). As Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Army, 
         | Prayut headed a coup d'etat in May 2014. The 2019 election was 
         | conducted under the new 2017 constitution designed by the 
         | military junta government. Collaborators note parts of the 
         | population dissatisfied with the current situation might have 
         | been reluctant or cautious to provide information on party  
         | preferences and political attitudes closely before or after the 
         | election day. This situation was amplified by official election 
         | results being published only weeks after the election. 
         | 
         | Further, other parts of the population might have been less 
         | knowledgeable concerning political issues such as parties' 
         | ideological classifications and hence might have had difficulties
         | answering related questions.

                 health and education even if it means raising taxes. Where
                 would you place yourself on this scale where 0 is 
                 "Governments should decrease taxes and spend less on
                 services" and 10 is "Governments should increase taxes and

         | 
         | E3012 ascertains whether or not the respondent cast a ballot
         | in the main election, regardless of whether or not it was valid.
         | The wording of this item, which is to record voting in the 
         | national election, follows national standards.
         |
         | In case of a single election taking place, e.g., a lower house
         | election only, then E3012 reports the turnout decision for that
         | particular election. In cases where multiple elections took 
         | place, e.g., a Presidential and a lower house election, E3012
         | reports the turnout decision in the main election. 
         | 
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitutes the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is
         | unavailable (e.g., when the CSES survey was administered in a
         | midterm election). For polities rated as mixed systems, CSES
         | has tended to classify the main election as elections to the
         | lower house. However, it sometimes deviates depending on data
         | availability. Users are advised to consult the table below 
         | specifying the main election for each study in CSES for specific
         | details.

         | several items in the Finnish study. This affected two CSES
         | items: turnout and vote choice variables.
         | The error was detected after the data collection had concluded.
         | To amend the problem, the data collection organization attempted
         | to re-contact the affected respondents by phone and ask the
         | questions that had not been included during the initial

         | Turnout for the 2019 Greek legislative election is significantly 
         | higher in the sample than expected given the official election 
         | results. Collaborators name several potential explanations for 
         | this discrepancy: 
         | Firstly, Collaborators note the electoral rolls might be outdated
         | in some instances, hence inflating the number of voters deemed 
         | eligible. For example, electoral registers sometimes still 
         | include Greek citizens who moved abroad or who were deceased 
         | (together amounting to 10% of persons listed in electoral rolls
         | according to various estimates). 
         | Secondly, non-voters either not interested in politics or of 
         | high age were presumably also less likely to participate in 
         | an electoral survey.
         | Finally, Collaborators note voting in Greece is compulsory, 
         | suggesting that some actual non-voters might have claimed to 
         | have turned out in the survey (social-desirability bias).

         | have voted. Apart from social desirability bias, Collaborators
         | note the observed discrepancy may partly originate from the 
         | sample design and a change in electoral rules preceding the 2019 
         | election: In 2019, eligible voters living abroad were added 
         | automatically to the electoral registers for the first time, 
         | resulting in an increase of 1.2 million registered voters. 
         | However, these newly registered voters, whose turnout is 
         | traditionally low, were not part of the sampling frame. 
         | Collaborators note turnout within the national territory of 
         | Portugal, the study's universe, was 54.6 percent in 2019 and 
         | thus considerably higher than the overall turnout.

         | The question of whether respondents voted in the "first round" of 
         | the current election did not differentiate between Presidential,
         | lower house and upper house elections. Since voting is 
         | compulsory, it can be assumed that most persons who answered 
         | "yes" voted in all of the elections, and those who answered "no"
         | did not vote in any of the elections, which took place
         | simultaneously. Furthermore, there were different kinds of "no"
         | answers in the original dataset which showed why respondents did
         | not vote. These values were recoded as follows:

         | Turnout for the lower (E3012_LH) and upper (E3012_UH) house 
         | elections was derived from a single question asking respondents
         | whether they had cast a ballot in the current elections.
         | Because the voting age for Italian Upper House Elections is 
         | 25, respondents younger than that were coded as "999993.

         | and the upper house were all held on July 1, 2018, and hence on 
         | the same day. Collaborators only asked respondents about their 
         | turnout in the Presidential election, as this contest was deemed
         | to be most salient. 
         | Respondents' turnout in the 2018 Presidential election is

         | CSES QUESTION CLASSIFICATION: DERIVATIVE VARIABLE (BASED ON CORE)

         | VARIABLE NOTES: E3012_TS
         |
         | E3012_TS is constructed based on the respondent's reported
         | turnout in the current and previous main election.
         | In polities where multiple elections took place simultaneously,
         | E3012_TS reports the turnout decision in the main election.
         | The classifications of the main election by election study are
         | listed in the variable notes for variable E3013_OUTGOV.
         |
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime 
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitutes the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is
         | unavailable (e.g., when the CSES survey was administered in a
         | midterm election). For polities rated as mixed systems, CSES
         | has tended to classify the main election as elections to the
         | lower house. However, it sometimes deviates depending on data
         | availability. Users are advised to consult the table listed in
         | VARIABLE NOTES for E3013_OUTGOV specifying the main election for 
         | each study in CSES for specific details.
         |
         | In instances when the previous turnout refers to a different type 
         | of election, e.g., current main elections are Presidential but
         | previous turnout variable refers to lower house election only,
         | these studies are set to missing for E3012_TS.
         |
         | Data are unavailable for TAIWAN (2016).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - COSTA RICA (2018): E3012_TS
         |

         | (E3012_PR_1 and E3014_PR_1).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - TAIWAN (2020): E3012_TS
         |
         | The main election in Taiwan is the Presidential election. Data 
         | on respondents' turnout of the second round of the Presidential 
         | election was, however, not available. Therefore, E3012_TS is

         | VARIABLE NOTES: E3012_FTV
         |
         | E3012_FTV ascertains whether or not the respondent is a 
         | first-time voter in the current main election.
         | Following the ACE Electoral Knowledge Network, CSES defines
         | first-time voters as "those young people who are reaching voting
         | age and therefore are facing their first opportunity to vote"
         | in the main election.
         | (see https://aceproject.org/ace-en/topics/ve/vee/vee05/vee05h,
         | Date accessed: February 05, 2023).
         |
         | Consequently, E3012_FTV classifies observations as first time
         | voters based on respondent age (variable E2001_Y).
         |
         | Respondents are classified as "1. R IS A FIRST-TIME VOTER" if
         | they attained voting age between the dates of the previous and
         | current main election.
         | Respondents who were eligible at the preceding main
         | election are coded "0. R IS NOT A FIRST-TIME VOTER".
         |
         | As CSES collects respondents' year and month of birth only (for 
         | further information see VARIABLE NOTES for E2001_Y), there are a
         | few instances in the dataset that could not be classified based 
         | on the above definition and are hence coded "6. NOT 
         | ASCERTAINABLE". This applies to the following observations:
         | - Respondents who reached voting age in the month of the
         |   previous main election.
         | - Respondents who reached voting age in the year of the previous
         |   main election and for whom data on the month of birth is
         |   unavailable.
         |
         | Data are coded "9. MISSING" primarily in instances where
         | respondents' year of birth (E2001_Y) is unavailable.
         |
         | In polities where multiple elections took place simultaneously,
         | this variable classifies first voters based on the main election.
         | The classifications of the main elections by election study are
         | listed in the VARIABLE NOTES for variable E3013_OUTGOV.
         |

         | 
         | "Together We Will Make History" was an electoral alliance in 
         | support of  Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and consisted of 
         | the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA, PARTY A), the Labor
         | Party (PT, PARTY G), and the Social Encounter Party 
         | (PES, PARTY I).
         |
         | "For Mexico to the Front" was an electoral alliance supporting 
         | Ricardo Anaya Cortes and encompassed the National Action Party 
         | (PAN, PARTY B), the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD, 
         | PARTY D), and Citizens' Movement (MC, PARTY F).
         | 
         | "Everyone for Mexico" associated with Jose Antonio Meade 
         | Kuribrena was made up of the Institutional Revolutionary Party 
         | (PRI, PARTY C), the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM, 
         | PARTY E), and the New Alliance Party (PNA, PARTY H).
         |
         | One respondent claimed to have voted for Margarita Zavala. 
         | Zavala contested the campaign as an independent candidate, but
         | withdrew her candidacy in May 2018. As votes for Zavala were 
         | counted as invalid votes ("nulos"), the respective respondent
         | was coded as 999993. INVALID/BLANK BALLOT.

         |
         | Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his party, the Justice and Development
         | Party (PARTY A) fared considerably better in the sample than 
         | expected given official election results for both the 
         | Presidential and the Lower House election. 
         | Collaborators state respondents might have been more inclined to
         | pick the winner in the post-election phase, a trend they also 
         | observed in an additional panel survey not included in CSES. 
         | Further, they suggest that Erdogan's and the AKP's popularity in
         | the sample might be a misrepresentation of party preferences 
         | rather than a sampling mistake since vote switching appeared 
         | primarily across the opposition parties in the separate panel 
         | study.

         |
         | Respondents were asked in the pre-election survey whether they
         | had voted already. Respondents who affirmed this were asked the
         | questions about their voting behavior (E3012_PR_1-E3013_UH_DC)
         | already in the pre-election survey. All other respondents were
         | asked the questions about their voting behavior in the post-
         | election part of the survey. Early voters are indicated as
         | belonging to a different sample component in variable E1007.
         |
         | The original data show that 20 respondents reported their 
         | voting behavior inconsistently. When asked before the elections
         | whether they had already participated in early voting they
         | answered yes. However, when asked after the elections they 
         | reported having voted on election day. For the CSES coding, the
         | answer given before the elections is assumed to be valid.

         |
         | The data collection organization programmed the questionnaire
         | incorrectly and consequently, 288 respondents were not asked
         | several items in the Finnish study. This affected two CSES
         | items: turnout and vote choice variables.
         | The error was detected after the data collection had concluded.
         | To amend the problem, the data collection organization attempted
         | to re-contact the affected respondents by phone and ask the
         | questions that had not been included during the initial
         | interview. The affected respondents did not retake the entire
         | interview.
         | Variable E1007 (Sample component) includes information that
         | enables users to distinguish these respondents in the Finland
         | (2019) study. SEE ELECTION STUDY NOTES - FINLAND (2019): E1007
         | for further information. 
         |
         | Further, for all survey variables including numeric party codes, 
         | the Finnish questionnaire included the open-ended option "Other 
         | party or group", allowing respondents to specify a party  
         | otherwise not included in the survey. Collaborators classified 
         | these open-ended answers into the following codes adopted for

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2021): E3013_LH_PL 
         | 
         | Researchers are advised that the Social Democratic Party 
         | (PARTY A) and the Greens (PARTY C) fared better in the sample 
         | than expected given official election results. At the same time,
         | the Union (PARTY B) and the AfD (PARTY E) did slightly worse in 
         | the sample than in the actual election.
         | Collaborators note although they used to have issues with the
         | overrepresentation of Green Party voters and underrepresentation
         | of AfD voters in past surveys, these distortions seem to be more
         | pronounced in 2021. They assume the reasons for this to be 
         | twofold: 
         | On the one hand, there are challenges in reaching AfD voters,
         | who appear to have lower-than-average participation rates, while
         | Green and SPD voters can be reached with ease due to, for 
         | example, higher political interest. On the other hand, there may
         | be distortions in socio-demographics, particularly in the 
         | underrepresentation of those with lower education levels and 
         | overrepresentation of those with higher education levels, whose
         | influence on vote choice cannot be fully compensated for by
         | weighting.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - HONG KONG (2016): E3013_LH_PL
         |
         | E3013_LH_PL reflects vote choice for geographical constituency
         | elections, which return 35 out of 70 seats for the unicameral
         | legislature of Hong Kong, the Legislative Council (LegCo). 
         | Voters cast one vote for closed party lists, which are compiled
         | separately for each of the five electoral districts and in some 
         | instances feature more than one list per party per district. 
         | The original vote choice variable assigned an individual code to
         | each party list. E3013_LH_PL summarizes vote choice for each 
         | combination of parties forming a joint party list.
         |
         | 22 respondents stated to have voted for a party list that did 
         | not compete in their electoral district. As it could not be 
         | assessed with certainty which lists these respondents actually
         | voted for, E3013_LH_PL was set to missing for these cases.
         |
         | Further, the 2016 Hong Kong study employed additional codes for

         |
         | In the 2018 lower house elections, voters could vote for a party 
         | list only, a party list and a district candidate, or a district 
         | candidate only. For voters who voted for a party list and a 
         | district candidate, split-ticket voting was not permitted. The 
         | ballots of voters who voted for either a party list or a 
         | district candidate were treated as a fused vote, i.e., the vote 
         | for a party list was automatically extended to the lists' 
         | respective district candidate (and vice-versa, i.e., a vote for 
         | a district candidate was extended to the candidate's party 
         | list). E3013_LH_PL reports the votes of those reporting to have 
         | cast a list vote and those who reported voting for both a party 
         | list and a district candidate. Respondents' vote choices for 
         | those who reported voting only for a district candidate were 
         | coded in E3013_LH_DC.
         | The original wording for what is coded here as "999997. REFUSED"
         | was "I would rather not say."

         | In the 2019 election to the Thai House of Representatives,
         | 350 members were elected by plurality vote in single-member
         | constituencies (district candidate vote) and 150 members 
         | were elected through a closed-list proportional representation 
         | system (party-list vote). However, voters cast a single fused 
         | vote for both segments. Hence, citizens are unable to split 
         | their vote among the candidates or lists of different parties. 
         | As variables E3013_LH_PL and E3013_LH_DC indicate respondents'
         | vote choice based on this single fused vote cast, they can be
         | used interchangeably.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - TURKEY (2018): E3013_LH_PL
         |
         | Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his party, the Justice and Development
         | Party (PARTY A) fared considerably better in the sample than 
         | expected given official election results for both the 
         | Presidential and the Lower House election. 
         | Collaborators state respondents might have been more inclined to
         | pick the winner in the post-election phase, a trend they also 
         | observed in an additional panel survey not included in CSES. 
         | Further, they suggest that Erdogan's and the AKP's popularity in
         | the sample might be a misrepresentation of party preferences 
         | rather than a sampling mistake since vote switching appeared 
         | primarily across the opposition parties in the separate panel 
         | study.

         | E3013_LH_DC details the respondent's vote choice for district 
         | candidate in Lower House elections, if applicable and a 
         | respondent cast a ballot in the Lower House legislative election.
         | Hence, E3013_LH_DC details reported vote choice, irrespective of

         | early/advance voting.
         |
         | If more than one candidate have one party's affiliation, 
         | Collaborators were advised to provide vote choice for individual
         | candidates. For preferential voting systems, Collaborators were

         | Three respondents reported having voted for a candidate of the
         | Independent Alliance (IA). These respondents were coded as

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ITALY (2018): E3013_LH_DC
         |
         | In the 2018 lower house elections, voters could vote for a party 
         | list only, a party list and a district candidate, or a district 
         | candidate only. For those who voted for a party list and a 
         | district candidate, split-ticket voting was not permitted. The 
         | ballots of voters who voted for either a party list or a 
         | district candidate were treated as a fused vote, i.e., the vote 
         | for a party list was automatically extended to the lists' 
         | respective district candidate (and vice-versa, i.e., a vote for 
         | a district candidate was extended to the candidate's party 
         | list). E3013_LH_DC reports the votes of those reporting to have 
         | cast a district candidate vote. Respondents' vote choices for 
         | those who reported having cast a party list vote or both a party 
         | list and a district candidate vote were coded in E3013_LH_PL.
         | Respondents who reported a district candidate vote were asked to
         | to name the party list or coalition of the candidate they voted
         | for which was used to code E3013_LH_DC. 
         | 56 Respondents named a candidate of one of the two large
         | coalitions, i.e., the center-right and the center-left
         | coalition. They were further asked which of the coalition 
         | members they liked most. The answer to the latter was coded as  
         | the respondent's vote choice in E3013_LH_DC as coalitions were  
         | not assigned numerical party codes. Finally, 13 respondents who
         | reported to have voted for one of the two coalitions did not
         | like any particular party from the coalition. These respondents
         | were coded to have voted for the leading party of the respective
         | coalition, namely, Lega (LN - NUMERICAL CODE: 380003) for the 
         | center-right coalition and the Democratic Party (PD - NUMERICAL 
         | CODE: 380002) for the center-left coalition.

         |
         | Respondents were asked in the pre-election survey whether they
         | had voted already. Respondents who affirmed this were asked the
         | questions about their voting behavior (E3012_PR_1-E3013_UH_DC)
         | already in the pre-election survey. All other respondents were
         | asked the questions about their voting behavior in the post-
         | election part of the survey. Early voters are indicated as
         | belonging to a different sample component in variable E1007.
         |
         | The original data show that 20 respondents reported their 
         | voting behavior inconsistently. When asked before the elections
         | whether they had already participated in early voting they
         | answered yes. However, when asked after the elections they 
         | reported having voted on election day. For the CSES coding, the
         | answer given before the elections is assumed to be valid.

         |
         | There are two different types of preference vote. The first is
         | associated with open PR-List systems. These systems allow  
         | citizens to vote for a party list and to mark a "preference" for 
         | one or more candidates within the party list. In these systems,
         | this type of vote is known as a preference vote (or a candidate 
         | vote). The second is associated with STV and AV systems, where
         | citizens rank-order candidates in descending order of their
         | preference. In these systems, a distinction is made between a
         | voter's first preference (i.e., who voters allocate their
         | "number 1" preference to) and their subsequent lower preferences.
         | These latter preferences (i.e., all the voter's preferences aside
         | from their first preference) are also known as preference votes.
         | We distinguish between these two different types of preference
         | votes in the above categorization. 
         |
         | In party list systems, the question asked of respondents should 
         | read like this: 
         | "Did you simply vote for a party or did you also express a 
         | candidate preference?"
         |
         | In party list systems where voters have to vote directly for a 
         | candidate and cannot cast a vote for the party list only (e.g., 
         | Estonia, Finland, and Poland), the question asked of respondents 
         | should read like this: 
         | "Do you consider the vote that you cast merely a vote for the 
         | party, or did you also mean it as a vote for a particular 
         | candidate?"
         |
         | In STV/AV systems, the question asked of respondents should be 
         | akin to this: 
         | "Which of the parties/candidates did you give your 
         | preference vote to?"
         | or 
         | "To whom did you give your second (or lower) preference vote to?"
         |
         | Respondents that mentioned not casting a ballot in the current
         | lower house election (E3012_LH) but reported a preference vote 
         | are included, as it is not possible to identify why this 
         | inconsistency occurred. Users may identify these cases by 
         | cross-tabulating E3012_LH and E3013_LH_PF in their statistical 
         | software.

         | Voters in Lithuania can cast a preference vote in the
         | multi-member constituency, proportional segment (party list
         | vote). Under the Lithuanian electoral law, a "voter shall mark 
         | the list of candidates whom he is voting for and, expressing his
         | opinion about the candidates on the list, shall enter the
         | election numbers of the 5 chosen candidates in the designated
         | spaces of the ballot paper. In this way preference votes are
         | given for the candidates." Voters are not required to express
         | preferences regarding the candidates.

         |
         | In the 2018 upper house elections, voters could vote for a party 
         | list only, a party list and a district candidate, or a district 
         | candidate only. For those who voted for a party list and a 
         | district candidate, split-ticket voting was not permitted. The 
         | ballots of voters who voted for either a party list or a 
         | district candidate were treated as a fused vote, i.e., the vote 
         | for a party list was automatically extended to the lists' 
         | respective district candidate (and vice-versa, i.e., a vote for 
         | a district candidate was extended to the candidate's party 
         | list). E3013_UH_DC_1 reports the votes of those reporting to 
         | have cast a district candidate vote. Respondents' vote choices 
         | for those who reported having cast a party list vote or both a 
         | party list and a district candidate vote were coded in 
         | E3013_UH_PL.
         | Respondents who reported a district candidate vote were asked to
         | to name the party list or coalition of the candidate they voted
         | for which was used to code E3013_UH_DC_1. 
         | 48 Respondents named a candidate of one of the two large
         | coalitions, i.e., the center-right and the center-left 
         | coalition. They were further asked which of the coalition 
         | members they liked most. The answer to the latter was coded as  
         | the respondent's vote choice in E3013_LH_DC_1 as coalitions were  
         | not assigned numerical party codes.

         |
         | Respondents were asked in the pre-election survey whether they
         | had voted already. Respondents who affirmed this were asked the
         | questions about their voting behavior (E3012_PR_1-E3013_UH_DC)
         | already in the pre-election survey. All other respondents were
         | asked the questions about their voting behavior in the post-
         | election part of the survey. Early voters are indicated as
         | belonging to a different sample component in variable E1007.
         |
         | The original data show that 20 respondents reported their 
         | voting behavior inconsistently. When asked before the elections
         | whether they had already participated in early voting they
         | answered yes. However, when asked after the elections they 
         | reported having voted on election day. For the CSES coding, the
         | answer given before the elections is assumed to be valid.

         | parties/coalitions, please see Part 3 of the CSES Codebook. 
         |
         | There are two different types of preference vote. The first is
         | associated with open PR-List systems. These systems allow 
         | citizens to vote for a party list and to mark a "preference" for 
         | one or more candidates within the party list. In these systems,
         | this type of vote is known as a preference vote (or a candidate 
         | vote). The second is associated with STV and AV systems, where
         | citizens rank-order candidates in descending order of their
         | preference. In these systems, a distinction is made between a
         | voter's first preference (i.e., who voters allocate their
         | "number 1" preference to) and their subsequent lower preferences.
         | These latter preferences (i.e., all the voter's preferences aside
         | from their first preference) are also known as preference votes.
         | We distinguish between these two different types of preference
         | votes in the above categorization. 
         |
         | In party list systems, the question asked of respondents should 
         | read like this: 
         | "Did you simply vote for a party or did you also express a 
         | candidate preference?"
         |
         | In party list systems where voters have to vote directly for a 
         | candidate and cannot cast a vote for the party list only (e.g., 
         | Estonia, Finland, & Poland), the question asked of respondents 
         | should read like this: 
         | "Do you consider the vote that you cast merely a vote for the 
         | party, or did you also mean it as a vote for a particular 
         | candidate?"
         |
         | In STV/AV systems, the question asked of respondents should be 
         | akin to this: 
         | "Which of the parties/candidates did you give your preference
         | vote to?"
         | or 
         | "To whom did you give your second (or lower) preference vote to?"
         |
         | Respondents that mentioned not casting a ballot in the current
         | upper house election (E3012_UH) but reported a vote choice are
         | included as it is not possible to identify why this 
         | inconsistency occurred. Users may identify these cases by 
         | cross-tabulating E3012_UH and E3013_UH_PF in their statistical 
         | software.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BRAZIL (2018): E3013_UH_PF
         |
         | 479 respondents reported having cast a preference vote after
         | also indicating they had not voted in the upper house election
         | (E3012_UH). Data remain unchanged.

         | CSES QUESTION CLASSIFICATION: DERIVATIVE VARIABLE (BASED ON CORE)

         | VARIABLE NOTES: E3013_OUTGOV
         |
         | E3013_OUTGOV ascertains whether or not the respondent cast a 
         | ballot for the outgoing incumbent, regardless of whether or not 
         | it was valid. 
         |
         | In case of a single election taking place, e.g., a lower house
         | election only, E3013_OUTGOV reports the voting decision for
         | that particular election. In cases where multiple elections took 
         | place, e.g., a Presidential and a lower house election, 
         | E3013_OUTGOV reports the voting decision in the main election. 
         |
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitutes the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is
         | unavailable (e.g., when the CSES survey was administered in a
         | midterm election). For polities rated as mixed systems, CSES
         | has tended to classify the main election as elections to the
         | lower house. However, it sometimes deviates depending on data
         | availability. Users are advised to consult the table below
         | specifying the main election for each study in CSES for specific 
         | details.
         |
         | In case of a Presidential election as main election, E3013_OUTGOV
         | refers to the incumbent President and/or the incumbent 
         | President's party. In all other cases, E3013_OUTGOV refers to 
         | the party/parties which was/were part of the outgoing cabinet. 
         | 
         | In mixed electoral systems where voters have a list vote and a 
         | district candidate vote, the list vote was used to determine if 
         | the respondent voted for the outgoing government or not.
         |
         | In case of a caretaker government, the party affiliations of its 
         | members were used to code E3013_OUTGOV. Cabinet members without
         | a formal party affiliation were not considered for E3013_OUTGOV.
         | 
         | Respondents who reported to have cast an invalid ballot are coded
         | as "0. DID NOT VOTE FOR THE OUTGOING GOVERNMENT (INCUMBENT)."

         | Nevertheless, E3013_OUTGOV is coded based on voters for the

         | party (ANO 2011) or the Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) 
         | which formed a minority government ahead of the 2021 election. 
         | While the minority government was backed by the Communist Party 
         | of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM), this party was not formally part 
         | of the cabinet and hence, is not included as an incumbent party.

         |
         | Finland went through a government crisis in 2017 when the Finns
         | Party split. The Finns Party was a member of the governing 
         | coalition in Finland. In 2017, after Jussi Halla-aho was elected 
         | as the Finns Party President, other coalition members (Center 
         | Party and National Coalition Party) declared that they did not 
         | want to continue cooperation with the Finns Party. As a result, 
         | the Finns Party went into opposition. However, 20 MPs abandoned 
         | the Finns Party and formed a new parliamentary group, which 
         | continued to support the governing coalition and hold ministers 
         | in Finland's government. This group became a new political party 
         | in Finland - Blue Reform.
         | Thus, supporters of the Center Party, National Coalition Party 
         | and Blue Reform are coded as voters of outgoing incumbents. 
         | Voters of the Finns Party were coded as those who did not vote 
         | for the outgoing incumbent government.

         | Macedonian naming dispute. As ANEL further did not participate
         | in the 2019 legislative elections, only respondents voting for

         | The March 2020 election was the third general election in Israel 
         | in the space of 12 months. Previous elections in April 2019 and 
         | September 2019 resulted in a hung parliament, where no new 
         | coalition government could be formed. Consequently, from April 
         | 9, 2019, Israel was governed by a caretaker coalition led by 
         | Benjamin Netanyahu as caretaker Prime Minister, comprising the
         | following parties: Likud, Kulanu, Shas, United Torah Judaism,
         | Jewish Home, and the New Right. The outgoing government variable
         | for Israel classifies this caretaker government as the incumbent

         | term, the same coalition governed Latvia from 2014 to 2018, and
         | those who voted for one of these parties in the 2018 elections

         | Presidential election.
         | Pena Nieto was elected as Mexican President to serve a six-year
         | term in the previous 2012 election. However, since all Mexican
         | Presidents are constitutionally limited to a single term, Pena
         | Nieto was not eligible for re-election. 
         | For the 2018 Presidential election, PRI nominated Jose Antonio

         | incumbent if they voted for Francisco Sagasti's party, the 
         | Purple Party (PM), in the current Presidential election. 
         | However, Francisco Sagasti was not elected President of Peru in
         | the 2016 elections. While there were many changes in the 
         | presidency, Sagasti finished the 2016-2021 term from November 
         | 16, 2020, to July 28, 2021, which was started by Pedro Pablo 
         | Kuczynski of the Peruvians for Change party on July 28, 2016.
         | Nevertheless, users should be aware that only 12 respondents 
         | voted for the Purple Party (PM) in the current Presidential 
         | election, so the meaningfulness is limited. For more information

         | VARIABLE NOTES: E3013_VS_1
         |
         | E3013_VS_1 ascertains whether or not the respondent reports 
         | voting for the same party/coalition in the current and previous
         | election or whether the respondent reports voting for a different
         | party/ coalition in the current election from the previous 
         | election. 
         | E3013_VS_1 is constructed based on the respondent's reported
         | vote choice in the current and previous main election.
         | In polities where multiple elections took place simultaneously,
         | E3013_VS_1 reports the vote-switching behavior in the main 
         | election.
         |
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitutes the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is
         | unavailable (e.g., when the CSES survey was administered in a
         | midterm election). For polities rated as mixed systems, CSES
         | has tended to classify the main election as elections to the
         | lower house. However, it sometimes deviates depending on data
         | availability. Users are advised to consult the table listed in
         | VARIABLE NOTES for E3013_OUTGOV specifying the main election for 
         | each study in CSES for specific details.

         | Respondents are classified as "0. DID NOT SWITCH" when they

         | or previous) for a party/coalition that did not exist or
         | contest in the other (current or previous) election.
         |
         | Respondents are classified as "9. MISSING" when data about

         | Additionally, respondents who report voting for an independent  
         | candidate or other parties without further specification are 
         | classified as "9. MISSING."
         | In instances where current and previous vote choice refer to

         |
         | E3013_LR_CSES is available for voters who reported voting for a 
         | party where expert judgments are available (i.e., for parties 
         | receiving an alphabetical classification by CSES). For more

         |
         | E3013_LR_CSES differentiates voters based on expert judgments
         | of the CSES Collaborators on the left-right ideology scale. 
         | Collaborators assign parties scores on an 11-point scale ranging
         | from "0. LEFT" to "10. RIGHT" for all parties assigned an 
         | alphabetical code by CSES. The expert judgment data by party 
         | is available in variable E5018_.  
         |
         | The coding of E3013_LR_CSES is based on E3100_LR_CSES. 
         | For E3100_LR_CSES, CSES linked the CSES Collaborator expert 
         | judgment with the reported vote choice of the respondent in the 
         | main election. A respondent who reports voting for a party/
         | candidate of PARTY A is assigned the value the CSES Collaborator 
         | gave to PARTY A in the said election on the left-right scale 
         | (and so on for PARTY B, PARTY C etc...). CSES reports these 
         | values in variable E3100_LR_CSES.          
         |
         | These scores provided in E3100_LR_CSES have then been 
         | re-classified for E3013_LR_CSES to establish whether a 
         | respondent voted for a leftist, center or rightist party/
         | candidate. Scores assigned by Collaborators are recoded into a 
         | trichotomy as follows:

         | 
         | In polities where multiple elections took place simultaneously, 
         | this variable reports the vote choice in the main election. 
         |
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitutes the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is
         | unavailable (e.g., when the CSES survey was administered in a
         | midterm election). For polities rated as mixed systems, CSES
         | has tended to classify the main election as elections to the
         | lower house. However, it sometimes deviates depending on data
         | availability. Users are advised to consult the table listed in
         | VARIABLE NOTES for E3013_OUTGOV specifying the main election for 
         | each study in CSES for specific details.  
         |         
         | Data are unavailable primarily because Collaborator expert 
         | judgments of parties were not provided for certain election
         | studies.

         | Research on Political Representation (MARPOR/CMP) data.
         | E3013_LR_MARPOR is based on the "RILE" index. The index was
         | developed by Laver and Budge (1992). It takes 24 categories (12
         | are defined as right-wing and 12 as left-wing) and subtracts the
         | sum of all right-wing items from the sum of all left-wing items.
         | The RILE index ranges from -100 (if a party only mentions left-
         | wing issues in its program) and +100 (if a party only mentions
         | right-wing issues in its program). However, these are the 
         | theoretical maximum and minimum values which are empirically
         | rare.

         | be found at https://manifestoproject.wzb.eu/
         | (Date accessed: May 03, 2023).
         | 
         | For E3100_LR_MARPOR, CSES linked the MARPOR/CMP data with the 
         | reported vote choice of the respondent in the main election.
         | A respondent who reports voting for a party/candidate of PARTY A 
         | is assigned the value the MARPOR/CMP RILE index gives to PARTY A

         | These scores provided in E3100_LR_MARPOR have then been 
         | re-classified for E3013_LR_MARPOR to establish whether a 
         | respondent voted for a leftist/rightist party/candidate. Scores 
         | assigned by Collaborators are recoded into a dichotomy as 
         | follows: 
         |
         |       E3013_LR_MARPOR         MARPOR RILE index
         |-----------------------------------------------------------------
         |                    00.        -100 - -0.01
         |                    01.        0.01 - 100.0
         |
         | When a party scores 0.00 on the RILE index, that usually means
         | that there is not enough data on the dimensions available to 
         | construct a reliable RILE estimate. These cases have been set to
         | "9. MISSING".       
         | 
         | In polities where multiple elections took place simultaneously, 
         | this variable reports the vote choice in the main election. 
         |
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitutes the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is
         | unavailable (e.g., when the CSES survey was administered in a
         | midterm election). For polities rated as mixed systems, CSES
         | has tended to classify the main election as elections to the
         | lower house. However, it sometimes deviates depending on data
         | availability. Users are advised to consult the table listed in
         | VARIABLE NOTES for E3013_OUTGOV specifying the main election for 
         | each study in CSES for specific details.  
         |
         | CSES and MARPOR/CMP have different scopes of parties/coalitions 
         | in elections and thus corresponding values assigned to
         | parties/coalitions by CSES Collaborators may be unavailable in
         | MARPOR/CMP and vice versa. 
         | In this variable, the L-R classifications assigned by MARPOR/CMP 
         | (originally available in E3100_MARPOR) are transformed into a
         | dichotomous variable.
         | Meanwhile, the L-R classifications assigned by CSES Collaborators
         | (available in E3013_LR_CSES and originally in E3100_LR_CSES and
         | E5018_ respectively) are transformed into a three-category
         | variable. Consequently, users are advised that this results in
         | some parties/coalitions falling into different categorizations
         | on E3013_LR_CSES and E3013_LR_MARPOR.
         |
         | Users are advised that CSES and MARPOR/CMP sometimes classify
         | coalitions differently in elections and across polities. For
         | example, CSES sometimes has data solely on coalitions and not 
         | the parties comprising the alliance, while MARPOR/CMP may have 
         | data concerning the individual parties in the coalition, or 
         | vice versa. Consequently, some parties may have multiple 
         | identifiers within the MARPOR/CMP dataset across time. A non 
         | comprehensive list of these deviations are noted in Part 3  
         | of the CSES Module Codebook in ELECTION STUDY NOTES.  
         |         
         | In certain elections, there can be little intra-study variation  
         | on this variable as all the main parties (i.e., those receiving 
         | most votes) are classified in one category (e.g., they are
         | all designated by MARPOR/CMP to have minus scores, and 
         | consequently, all are deemed to be on the left of the ideological
         | spectrum). In CSES MODULE 5, this occurs for the following
         | studies: 
         |      - Australia (2019)
         |      - Iceland (2017)
         |      - Japan (2017)
         |      - Lithuania (2020)
         |      - South Korea (2016)
         |      - Turkey (2018)
         | Intra-study variation can be obtained by consulting variable 
         | E3100_LR_MARPOR. 
         |         
         | Data are unavailable primarily because some polities which are
         | in the CSES are not represented in the MARPOR/CMP dataset.
         | Data are unavailable for AUSTRALIA (2019), BRAZIL (2018), CANADA
         | (2019), CHILE (2017), COSTA RICA (2018), FRANCE (2017), HONG

         | answered "yes" voted in all of the elections, and those who
         | answered "no" did not vote in any of the elections, which took
         | place simultaneously. Furthermore, there were different kinds of

         | answered "yes" voted in all of the elections, and those who
         | answered "no" did not vote in any of the elections, which took
         | place simultaneously. Furthermore, there were different kinds of
         | "no" answers in the original dataset which showed why

         | Social Democratic Party (PSD, NUMERICAL CODE: 642001) and the 
         | National Liberal Party (PNL, NUMERICAL CODE: 642002) were both 
         | members of the electoral alliance Social Liberal Union (NUMERICAL
         | CODE: 642017) in 2012. A tabulation of E3015_LH_DC nevertheless 
         | shows that voters reported that they cast ballots for the 
         | individual member parties in the previous 2012 election, even 
         | though these were alliance members. Since the coalition no longer
         | existed and the question referred to the last election, which was
         | almost five years ago at the time of the survey, respondents 
         | probably still indicated that they voted for their favorite party
         | and not for the coalition that no longer existed.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - COSTA RICA (2018): E3017_
         |
         | In the Costa Rican 2018 election study, 109 respondents 
         | evaluated all parties equally on the like/dislike scale. 
         | One potential reason is that in Cost Rica, the support of 
         | political parties has eroded in the last two decades. Therefore,
         | individuals are less likely to identify with parties. Asking 
         | them to evaluate parties or leaders can thus show odd results.  

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - INDIA (2019): E3017_
         | 
         | PARTY A (Indian People's Party) and PARTY B (Indian National 
         | Congress) are the two major parties in India with national 
         | significance. All other parties contest in selected states only, 
         | where party organizations tend to be state-specific. 
         | Consequently, Collaborators advise conducting analyses on the 
         | state rather than the national level for PARTIES C - I. 
         | Further information on data availability for E3017_C-I and 
         | details on parties' regional concentrations are available in

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - THAILAND (2019): E3017_
         |
         | For some variables in the Thai 2019 election study, such as 
         | E3017_, an unusually high share of respondents did not provide 
         | substantive answers (> 20% of data coded refused, don't know, or 
         | missing). Collaborators note two potential reasons for this 
         | peculiarity:
         |
         | At the time of the election, Thailand's incumbent Prime 
         | Minister was Prayut Chan-o-cha, leader of the State Power Party 
         | (PPRP, PARTY A). As Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Army, 
         | Prayut headed a coup d'etat in May 2014. The 2019 election was 
         | conducted under the new 2017 constitution designed by the 
         | military junta government. Collaborators note parts of the 
         | population dissatisfied with the current situation might have 
         | been reluctant or cautious to provide information on party  
         | preferences and political attitudes closely before or after the 
         | election day. This situation was amplified by official election 
         | results being published only weeks after the election. 
         | 
         | Further, other parts of the population might have been less 
         | knowledgeable concerning political issues such as parties' 
         | ideological classifications and hence might have had difficulties
         | answering related questions.

         | Presidents or Vice Presidents of the Legislative Assembly from 
         | the four major political parties between 2014 and 2021.
         | The Presidents and Vice Presidents are members of the 
         | Legislative Assembly, but they are not party leaders.
         | Given the interaction between the President of the Executive 
         | Branch and the political parties represented in the legislature, 
         | Collaborators considered it relevant to include them, since the
         | President did not have a majority in the legislature at that

         | the picture. Those respondents declaring not to know the 
         | candidate after seeing the picture were told the candidate's

         | 
         | The question wording for E3018_ deviates slightly from the CSES 
         | MODULE 5 standards, using an 11-point scale ranging from -5 to
         | +5. It translates to:
         |
         | "And what do you think of some of the leading politicians? 
         | Please rate them using again the scale from -5 to +5, where -5 
         | means you strongly dislike that politician and +5 means that you 
         | strongly like that politician. If you feel you do not know  
         | enough about a politician you do not need to evaluate him/her.
         | What do you think of ... ".
         |
         | In the original 2017 study, respondents were asked to evaluate 10  
         | politicians of 6 parties. Adhering to the CSES scheme, only one 
         | leader for each party was chosen by Collaborators to be included 
         | in E3018_. For further information about party and leader

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - COSTA RICA (2018): E3019_
         |
         | In the Costa Rican 2018 election study, 43 respondents rated
         | all parties equally on the left/right scale. 
         | SEE ELECTION STUDY NOTES - COSTA RICA (2018): E3017_ for more
         | information.
         | Furthermore, some respondents are split on whether to rate a
         | party as left or right. An overview of mean voter and expert
         | placements shows that voters and experts disagree significantly
         | on average where to place parties on the left-right scale. 
         | Those divergences in party placements are based on various
         | factors. Individuals in Costa Rica have very ambivalent ideas
         | or opinions regarding parties' ideologies. Mean voters have 
         | serious difficulties classifying parties based on ideological 
         | principles. Furthermore, parties do not have clear policy 
         | positions that would help respondents to evaluate what parties 
         | stand for. This has been this way since the 1980s. In part, the 
         | transformation of the party system in the last two decades (from 
         | a two-party system into a multi-party one) is related to the 
         | erosion of parties' ideological principles.
         | Experts' opinions are quite different from mean voters. Experts
         | use their judgments and professional knowledge to label parties.
         | In sum, ideology is not a straightforward factor among 
         | respondents for classifying parties.  

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - FRANCE (2017): E3019_
         |
         | Left-Right party placements for the 2017 French election study
         | are available for PARTY C (The Republicans) and PARTY E 
         | (Socialist Party). 
         | For PARTY A (The Republic Onwards), PARTY B (National Front) and 
         | PARTY D (Indomitable France) respondents were asked to place 
         | Presidential candidates, not parties, on the left-right scale. 
         | These placements of Presidential candidates are available in 
         | E3021_ (Optional Alternative Scale).
         | Collaborators state the reasoning behind that decision is the
         | empirical observation that respondents do not differentiate
         | between party and leader placements in France 
         | (Presidentialization of parties). However, Collaborators 
         | expected respondents to differentiate between the candidates
         | of the Republicans and the Socialist Party and their parties, 
         | which is why they included party placements for these two
         | parties.
         |
         | For E3019_ - E3021_, answers coded as 99 "Missing" apply to all 
         | missing respondents or blank answers (no additional precision in 
         | the data).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - INDIA (2019): E3019_
         |
         | Collaborators note the left-right ideological scale is not 
         | applicable to the Indian party system and question whether most
         | respondents understand the scale's meaning. 
         | Additionally, they state that there is no consensus on whether 
         | ideology matters for Indian elections, which is why they did not
         | employ an alternative scale either. Rather, there is an argument
         | that caste identity is most relevant in analyzing vote choice 
         | for Indian elections. 
         |
         | For further information on the role of ideology in India, 
         | Collaborators recommend the following literature:

         |
         | PARTY A (Indian People's Party) and PARTY B (Indian National 
         | Congress) are the two major parties in India with national 
         | significance. All other parties contest in selected states only, 
         | where party organizations tend to be state-specific. 
         | Consequently, Collaborators advise conducting analyses on the 
         | state rather than the national level for PARTIES C - I. 
         | Further information on data availability for E3019_C-I and 
         | details on parties' regional concentrations are available in

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - MEXICO (2018): E3019_
         |
         | Pointing to previous research, Collaborators note there might be
         | a clear and marked discrepancy in Mexico between the way people
         | place themselves on the left-right and liberal-conservative 
         | scales and their objective location on these scales based on 
         | policy positions. This discrepancy might be one explanation for
         | the occurence of rare or contradictory responses to party or 
         | leader placements. For more information, see Bertran, U. 2012.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - THAILAND (2019): E3019_
         |
         | For some variables in the Thai 2019 election study, such as 
         | E3019_, an unusually high share of respondents did not provide 
         | substantive answers (> 20% of data coded refused, don't know, or 
         | missing). Collaborators note two potential reasons for this 
         | peculiarity:
         |
         | At the time of the election, Thailand's incumbent Prime 
         | Minister was Prayut Chan-o-cha, leader of the State Power Party 
         | (PPRP, PARTY A). As Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Army, 
         | Prayut headed a coup d'etat in May 2014. The 2019 election was 
         | conducted under the new 2017 constitution designed by the 
         | military junta government. Collaborators note parts of the 
         | population dissatisfied with the current situation might have 
         | been reluctant or cautious to provide information on party  
         | preferences and political attitudes closely before or after the 
         | election day. This situation was amplified by official election 
         | results being published only weeks after the election. 
         | 
         | Further, other parts of the population might have been less 
         | knowledgeable concerning political issues such as parties' 
         | ideological classifications and hence might have had difficulties
         | answering related questions.

         | In this item battery, respondents were asked to place parties on 
         | a value-oriented left-right scale. The question was worded as 
         | follows:
         | "In politics people sometimes talk about a value-based 
         | left-right scale, where 'left' represents being open to 
         | immigrants, focusing on prevention over strict punishment as a 
         | solution to crime, and focusing on the climate and protection of 
         | the environment, while 'right' represents a strict judicial 
         | policy and immigration policy, as well as economic issues being 
         | prioritized over the environment and the climate.
         | Where would you place the following parties on a scale of 0-10, 
         | where 0 means most left and 10 means most right?"

         | E3021_A, E3021_B and E3021_D refer to respondents' placements
         | of Presidential candidates on the left-right scale. 
         | For PARTY A (The Republic Onwards), PARTY B (National Front) and 
         | PARTY D (Indomitable France) respondents were asked to place 
         | Presidential candidates, not parties, on the left-right scale. 
         | Collaborators state the reasoning behind that decision is the
         | empirical observation that respondents do not differentiate
         | between party and leader placements in France 
         | (Presidentialization of parties). However, Collaborators 
         | expected respondents to differentiate between the candidates
         | of the Republicans and the Socialist Party and their parties, 
         | which is why they included party placements for these two
         | parties.

         | For some variables in the Thai 2019 election study, such as 
         | E3021_, an unusually high share of respondents did not provide 
         | substantive answers (> 20% of data coded refused, don't know, or 
         | missing). Collaborators note two potential reasons for this 
         | peculiarity:
         |
         | At the time of the election, Thailand's incumbent Prime 
         | Minister was Prayut Chan-o-cha, leader of the State Power Party 
         | (PPRP, PARTY A). As Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Army, 
         | Prayut headed a coup d'etat in May 2014. The 2019 election was 
         | conducted under the new 2017 constitution designed by the 
         | military junta government. Collaborators note parts of the 
         | population dissatisfied with the current situation might have 
         | been reluctant or cautious to provide information on party  
         | preferences and political attitudes closely before or after the 
         | election day. This situation was amplified by official election 
         | results being published only weeks after the election. 
         | 
         | Further, other parts of the population might have been less 
         | knowledgeable concerning political issues such as parties' 
         | ideological classifications and hence might have had difficulties
         | answering related questions.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - THAILAND (2019): E3024_3
         |
         | For some variables in the Thai 2019 election study, such as 
         | E3024_, an unusually high share of respondents did not provide 
         | substantive answers (> 20% of data coded refused, don't know, or 
         | missing). Collaborators note two potential reasons for this 
         | peculiarity:
         |
         | At the time of the election, Thailand's incumbent Prime 
         | Minister was Prayut Chan-o-cha, leader of the State Power Party 
         | (PPRP, PARTY A). As Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Army, 
         | Prayut headed a coup d'etat in May 2014. The 2019 election was 
         | conducted under the new 2017 constitution designed by the 
         | military junta government. Collaborators note parts of the 
         | population dissatisfied with the current situation might have 
         | been reluctant or cautious to provide information on party  
         | preferences and political attitudes closely before or after the 
         | election day. This situation was amplified by official election 
         | results being published only weeks after the election. 
         | 
         | Further, other parts of the population might have been less 
         | knowledgeable concerning political issues such as parties' 
         | ideological classifications and hence might have had difficulties
         | answering related questions.

         | as answer to E3024_2 (also SEE ELECTION STUDY NOTES - UNITED

         | The answer categories for E3024_4 offered to respondents deviated
         | from CSES MODULE 5 standards. In the French election study,  
         | E3024_4 included four categories ("very close", "somewhat 
         | close", "not very close", "not close at all") while the CSES 
         | standard question only differentiates between "very close", 
         | "somewhat close", and "not very close". For E3024_4, the 
         | original answer categories "not very close" and "not close at

         | E3100_LR_CSES links the respondents' reported vote choice in the 
         | main election with the CSES Collaborators experts' judgment of  
         | the party the respondent reported voting for on the ideological 
         | left-right scale (0-10). 
         |
         | E3100_LR_CSES is available for voters who reported voting for a 
         | party where expert judgments are available (i.e., for parties 
         | receiving an alphabetical classification by CSES). For more 
         | details on which parties/coalitions receive alphabetical 
         | classification see "CSES MODULE 5 CODING OF PARTIES/COALITIONS
         | & LEADERS" in Codebook Part 3. 
         |
         | E3100_LR_CSES assigns respondents a score based on respondent 
         | reported vote choice and the corresponding expert judgment 
         | of the CSES Collaborators on the left-right ideology scale for 
         | the party the respondent reports voting for.        
         | Collaborators assign parties scores on an 11-point scale ranging
         | from "0. LEFT" to "10. RIGHT" for all parties assigned an 
         | alphabetical code by CSES. The expert judgment data by party 
         | is available in variable E5018_.
         |
         | Some parties/coalitions have scores that are not round numbers,
         | e.g., 1.5 or 3.5. These scores can reflect Collaborator
         | judgments or reflect the classification of a coalition. 
         | Sometimes respondents report voting for a coalition, but
         | Collaborators score parties that comprise this coalition
         | separately on the L-R scale. The score used for E3100_LR_CSES
         | is the mean of L-R scores of parties that comprise the given
         | coalition. 
         | All of these instances are detailed in ELECTION STUDY NOTES 
         | below.        
         |
         | E3100_LR_CSES links the CSES Collaborator expert judgment with  
         | the reported vote of the respondent in the main election. Here, 
         | a respondent who reports voting for a party/candidate of PARTY A
         | is assigned the value the CSES Collaborator gave to PARTY A in 
         | the said election on the left-right scale (and so on for PARTY B, 
         | PARTY C etc...). 
         |
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitutes the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is
         | unavailable (e.g., when the CSES survey was administered in a
         | midterm election). For polities rated as mixed systems, CSES
         | has tended to classify the main election as elections to the
         | lower house. However, it sometimes deviates depending on data
         | availability. Users are advised to consult the table listed in
         | VARIABLE NOTES for E3013_OUTGOV specifying the main election for 
         | each study in CSES for specific details.

         | on the MARPOR "rile" index. The index was developed by Laver and
         | Budge (1992). It takes 24 categories (12 are defined as right-
         | wing and 12 as left-wing) and subtracts the sum of all right-wing
         | items from the sum of all left-wing items. The RILE index ranges
         | from -100 (if a party only mentions left-wing issues in its 
         | program) and +100 (if a party only mentions right-wing issues in
         | its program). However, these are the theoretical maximum and

         | E3100_LR_MARPOR links the MARPOR "rile" index value with the  
         | reported vote of the respondent in the main election. Here, a
         | respondent who reports voting for a party/candidate of PARTY A
         | is assigned the value MARPOR "rile" index gave to PARTY A in
         | the said election (and so on for PARTY B, PARTY C etc...). 
         |
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitutes the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is
         | unavailable (e.g., when the CSES survey was administered in a
         | midterm election). For polities rated as mixed systems, CSES
         | has tended to classify the main election as elections to the
         | lower house. However, it sometimes deviates depending on data
         | availability. Users are advised to consult the table listed in
         | VARIABLE NOTES for E3013_OUTGOV specifying the main election for 
         | each study in CSES for specific details.
         |
         | Users are advised that CSES and MARPOR/CMP sometimes classify 
         | coalitions differently in elections and across polities. For
         | example CSES sometimes has data solely on coalitions and not 
         | the parties comprising the alliance, while MARPOR/CMP may have 
         | data concerning the individual parties in the coalition, or 
         | vice versa. Consequently, some parties may have multiple 
         | identifiers within the MARPOR/CMP dataset across time. A non      
         | comprehensive list of these deviations are noted in Part 3  
         | of the CSES MODULE 5 Codebook in ELECTION STUDY NOTES.
         |         
         | Data are unavailable primarily because some polities, which are
         | in the CSES, are not represented in the MARPOR/CMP dataset.
         | Data are unavailable for AUSTRALIA (2019), BRAZIL (2018), CANADA

         |
         | E3100_POP_CSES links the respondents' reported vote choice in the
         | main election with the CSES Collaborators experts' judgment of 
         | the party the respondent reported voting for on the populism 
         | scale (0-10). 
         |
         | E3100_POP_CSES is available for voters who reported voting for a 
         | party where expert judgments are available (i.e., for parties 
         | receiving an alphabetical classification by CSES). For more 
         | details on which parties/coalitions receive alphabetical 
         | classification see "CSES MODULE 5 CODING OF PARTIES/COALITIONS
         | & LEADERS" in Codebook Part 3. 
         |
         | E3100_POP_CSES assigns respondents a score based on respondents' 
         | reported vote choice and the corresponding CSES Collaborators 
         | expert placement of the party voted for on the populism scale.
         | This variable hence links the CSES Collaborator expert judgment 
         | with the reported vote of the respondent in the main election.  
         | Here, a respondent who reports voting for a party/candidate of
         | PARTY A is assigned the value the CSES Collaborator gave to  
         | PARTY A in the said election on the populism scale (and so on 
         | for PARTY B, PARTY C etc...).
         |  
         | Collaborators assign parties scores on an 11-point scale ranging
         | from "0. NOT AT ALL POPULIST" to "10. VERY POPULIST" for all 
         | parties assigned an alphabetical code by CSES. The expert 
         | judgment data by party used for coding E3100_POP_CSES is 
         | available in variable E5020_.
         |
         | For classifying parties on the populism scale, Collaborators were
         | provided with the following definition:
         | "Definition: Populism can be defined as a thin-centered ideology
         | that pits a virtuous and homogeneous people against a set of 
         | elites and dangerous 'others' who are depicted as depriving
         | "the people" of their rights, values, prosperity, identity, and
         | voice. The emphasis on anti-elite/ anti-establishment rhetoric 
         | and the contrast between the "pure people" and the "corrupt 
         | elite" are thus indications of the degree to which a party is 
         | populist. Populist parties can be found across the left-right 
         | ideological spectrum."
         |
         | E3100_POP_CSES is coded based on respondents' vote choice in the 
         | main election. 
         |
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitutes the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is
         | unavailable (e.g., when the CSES survey was administered in a
         | midterm election). For polities rated as mixed systems, CSES
         | has tended to classify the main election as elections to the
         | lower house. However, it sometimes deviates depending on data
         | availability. Users are advised to consult the table listed in
         | VARIABLE NOTES for E3013_OUTGOV specifying the main election for 
         | each study in CSES for specific details.  
         |
         | Some parties/coalitions have scores in E3100_POP_CSES that are 
         | not round numbers, e.g., 1.5 or 5.5. These scores can reflect 
         | Collaborator judgments or reflect the classification of a 
         | coalition. Sometimes respondents report voting for a coalition, 
         | but Collaborators score parties that comprise this coalition
         | separately on the populism scale. The score used for 
         | E3100_POP_CSES is the mean of populism scores of parties that 
         | comprise the given coalition. All of these instances are detailed
         | in ELECTION STUDY NOTES below.        
         |
         | Sometimes parties' levels of populism are hard to determine. 
         | These instances are detailed in ELECTION STUDY NOTES for 
         | variable E5020_.

         | CSES QUESTION CLASSIFICATION: DERIVATIVE VARIABLE (BASED ON CORE)

         | VARIABLE NOTES: E3100_IF_CSES
         |
         | E3100_IF_CSES links the respondents' reported vote choice in the 
         | main election with the CSES Collaborators experts' judgment of 
         | the ideological family of the party the respondent reported 
         | voting for.
         |
         | E3100_IF_CSES is available for voters who reported voting for a 
         | party where expert judgments are available (i.e., for parties 
         | receiving an alphabetical classification by CSES). For more 
         | details on which parties/coalitions receive alphabetical 
         | classification see "CSES MODULE 5 CODING OF PARTIES/COALITIONS
         | & LEADERS" in Codebook Part 3. 
         |
         | E3100_IF_CSES assigns respondents a score based on respondent 
         | reported vote choice and the corresponding CSES Collaborators 
         | expert judgments of the party's ideological family.
         | The expert judgment data by party is available in variable
         | E5017_.      
         |
         | E3100_IF_CSES links the CSES Collaborator expert judgment with  
         | the reported vote of the respondent in the main election. Here, 
         | a respondent who reports voting for a party/candidate of PARTY A
         | is assigned the value the CSES Collaborator gave to PARTY A in 
         | the said election on the left-right scale (and so on for PARTY B, 
         | PARTY C etc...). 
         |
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitutes the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is
         | unavailable (e.g., when the CSES survey was administered in a
         | midterm election). For polities rated as mixed systems, CSES
         | has tended to classify the main election as elections to the
         | lower house. However, it sometimes deviates depending on data
         | availability. Users are advised to consult the table listed in
         | VARIABLE NOTES for E3013_OUTGOV specifying the main election for 
         | each study in CSES for specific details.          
         |
         | In some instances, CSES Collaborators provide additional 
         | information to the characterization, and when applicable, these 
         | are detailed in the ELECTION STUDY NOTES for variable E5017_.
         |
         | Users are advised that the same party might have been coded as 
         | belonging to different party families across different
         | elections. These differences may reflect actual changes in
         | parties' ideological positions across time. 
         | Alternatively, they might reflect disagreement on different 
         | experts on which ideological family the respective party 
         | belongs to, whenever national Collaborators changed between 
         | election studies. 
         |
         | Data are unavailable primarily because Collaborator expert 
         | judgments of parties were not provided for certain election
         | studies.

         | E3013_LH_PL. For respondents who reported voting for a district 
         | candidate only, E3100_IF_CSES was coded based on E3013_LH_DC.

))) CSES MODULE 5 VARIABLES: DISTRICT-LEVEL DATA
===========================================================================

         | VARIABLE NOTES:
         |
         | (1) Respondents' electoral districts are reported in E2021,
         |     with labels listed in Part 4 of the CSES Codebook.
         |
         | (2) According to the different types of elections included in
         |     this CSES release, the tables below provide an overview of 
         |     each polity and to which election the district data 
         |     pertains to, detail the number of districts in total in 
         |     each state and the number of these districts which are 
         |     sampled by studies included in CSES, and provide information
         |     about the electoral tier (where applicable) to which the 
         |     district data pertain to. Users are advised to consult these
         |     tables carefully to decide which data is appropriate for
         |     their analyses. 
         |
         | (3) In mixed systems, such as Germany or New Zealand, district 
         |     data refers to the constituency vote (as opposed to the 
         |     list-PR vote).
         |
         | (4) There are two versions of each district-level variable. 
         |     Most election studies are coded into E4001-E4007. For 
         |     polities that operate one nationwide electoral district,
         |     district data are coded into variables E4001_N-E4007_N 
         |     to specifically highlight one nationwide district polities.

             001-900. NUMBER OF SEATS CONTESTED IN ELECTORAL DISTRICT

             997.     NOT APPLICABLE

         | VARIABLE NOTES: E4001
         |
         | E4001 details the number of seats contested in each district of
         | the first segment of the lower house of the legislature.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRIA (2017): E4001
         |
         | The data represents the first electoral tier (Regionalwahl- 
         | kreis). Seats in Austria are distributed across three tiers 
         | (Regionalwahlkreis-tier 1; Landwahlkreis-tier 2; and the  
         | federal level-tier 3). To win seats (the constituencies at the 
         | Regionalwahlkreis are multi-seat constituencies), a party
         | must reach a quota(s). The quota is calculated by dividing 
         | the number of valid votes cast in the Landwahlkreis (tier 2) 
         | that the said Regionalwahlkreis is in, by the number of seats 
         | allocated to the Landwahlkreis (tier 2) in total. If no party 
         | surpasses this quota, no seat is allocated at tier 1 and these
         | votes go into the mix in deciding the allocation of seats at 
         | the Landwahlkreis (tier 2). Hence, the number of seats that
         | parties may have won (E4005_A-E4005_F) in a district may differ
         | from the number of seats which parties compete for at the lowest
         | tier (E4001).  

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - UNITED STATES (2016 & 2020): E4001
         |
         | E4001 reports the number of electoral college votes
         | allocated to each state in the U.S. Presidential election and not
         | the number of congressional seats in each district.
         | Considering that the United States uses an electoral college 
         | system that operates on the state level, district data was 
         | collected accordingly. The U.S. state a respondent lives in is 
         | coded in E2020 (REGION OF RESIDENCE). Variable E2021 reports the 
         | respondent's lower house district.

         | They correspond to parties A-F (i.e., Leader A will be related to

         | are voluntarily provided by each country's election study and 
         | often include data about additional personalities of interest. 
         | For example, in a parliamentary system, data about a President 
         | might be provided, even if the Presidency is not being contested.
         | On many occasions, slots Leader G, H, and I will include

         |
         | Almost all Belgian parties are divided into linguistic groups,

         | that do and that are assigned an alphabetical classification by  
         | CSES are noted below). Instead, most parties compete in one of  
         | two predominant linguistic regions of the country, namely 
         | Belgium-Flanders (Dutch-speaking region) and Belgium-Wallonia 
         | (French-speaking region). There is also a German-speaking region
         | which for elections to the Belgian Parliament (Chamber of 
         | Representatives) is located within the Belgium-Wallonia 
         | of Liege. Thus, elections to Belgium's national parliament 
         | essentially operate as two distinct elections for one chamber.  
         | Accordingly, the data represents the percentage of votes 
         | received by parties standing in the Flanders regions only, 
         | namely: Antwerp, East Flanders, Flemish Brabant, Limburg, and
         | West Flanders. Parties are allocated alphabetical classifications

         |
         | PARTY A (New Flemish Alliance, N-VA) - 16.0%

         | Multiple estimates of the national election results are
         | available from a wide variety of sources. These sources
         | often differ in the final vote tallies provided for each
         | party, most likely a consequence of the fact that counting
         | is done at a state level, and accordingly, votes are sometimes
         | reported in different ways and at different time points. The
         | estimates of party vote share in the US House of Representative
         | elections are based on the data reported by the US Congressional
         | Election Information Statistics of the Presidential and

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BELGIUM-FLANDERS (2019): E5002
         |
         | Almost all Belgian parties are divided into linguistic groups, 
         | and therefore, few parties compete on a national basis (those 
         | that do and that are assigned an alphabetical classification by  
         | CSES are noted below). Instead, most parties compete in one of  
         | two predominant linguistic regions of the country, namely 
         | Belgium-Flanders (Dutch-speaking region) and Belgium-Wallonia 
         | (French-speaking region). There is also a German-speaking region
         | which for elections to the Belgian Parliament (Chamber of 
         | Representatives) is located within the Belgium-Wallonia area of
         | of Liege. Thus, elections to Belgium's national parliament 
         | essentially operate as two distinct elections for one chamber.  
         | Accordingly, the data represents the percentage of seats 
         | contested in the Flanders regions only (87 of the 150 seats in 
         | total in the Chamber of Representatives), namely: Antwerp, East 
         | Flanders, Flemish Brabant, Limburg, and West Flanders. 
         |
         | The percentage of seats achieved by each party standing in  
         | the Belgium-Flanders region in Belgium as a unified entity is

         |
         | PARTY A (New Flemish Alliance, N-VA) - 16.7%
         | PARTY B (Vlaams Belangm, VB) - 12.0%

         | total in the Chamber of Representatives), namely: Brabant, 
         | Hainaut, Liege, Luxembourg, and Namur. Data from the Brussels

         | Election Study did not include respondents from Northern 
         | Ireland.
         |        
         | While the Conservative Party achieved a majority of seats
         | in Great Britain (318/632=50.2%), including the seats 
         | from Northern Ireland (n=18 seats), the party fell short of 
         | a parliamentary majority (318/650=48.9%), necessitating a 
         | confidence and supply deal with the Democratic Unionist Party 
         | (DUP). They are a religious party who contests seats in Northern 
         | Ireland only, and had won 10 of the province's 18 seats. 
         | Nonetheless, as Sinn Fein, an Irish Nationalist Party, won the

         | VARIABLE NOTES: E5006_2
         |
         | E5006_2 details the Voting Age Population (VAP), which includes 
         | all citizens above the legal voting age in a country. It is not 
         | intended to be a precise measure of the number of citizens
         | entitled to vote as it does not take into account legal or 
         | systematic impediments such as resident non-citizens. Rather, its 
         | intent is to provide an estimate of turnout besides estimates 
         | based solely on an electoral register. Voter registers are often 
         | outdated or inaccurate or in some circumstances are not used 
         | for elections (e.g., 1994 South African elections).        
         |
         | In some polities, voters are registered automatically and hence
         | it might be expected that the electoral register measure and the
         | voting age population can be identical. This is not always the
         | case for the reasons set out above. However, and unless we can
         | verify the accuracy, CSES reports the Voting Age Population as 
         | listed by the IDEA. However, ELECTION STUDY NOTES below do alert 
         | users to instances where voter registration is automatic and  
         | thus to cases in which in theory the ER and VAP estimates could  
         | be identical.

         | The Voting Age Population estimate comes from the United States 
         | Elections Project. The Voting Age Population estimate often  
         | includes citizens who are ineligible to vote (for example,

         | an estimate of the Voting Age Population excluding ineligible

         | 
         | The Voting Eligible Population (VEP) estimate is based on a
         | denominator of 239,247,182 and yields a VEP turnout rate of

         | outgoing Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. In April 2020, 
         | the Gantz faction of Kahol Lavan formed a national unity 
         | government with Likud and other parties, with a rotating 
         | Prime Ministership arrangement, akin to a similar arrangement
         | in Israel in the 1980s between Yitzak Shamir (Likud) and Shimon
         | Peres (Labor). Incumbent Premier Netanyahu (Likud, National
         | Liberal Party, PARTY A) would continue to serve as Prime Minister 
         | for 18 months, with Gantz serving as Defense Minister. Later 
         | Gantz was scheduled to replace Netanyahu as Prime Minister, with
         | himself also serving for 18 months. The national unity government 
         | was sworn into office on May 17, 2020. However, the government

         | as to where parties/coalitions are located on the left-right
         | ideological scale. Sometimes parties'/coalitions' ideological 
         | differences in certain polities on the left-right scale are 
         | difficult to detect, perhaps because party competition is not 
         | structured on a left-right dimension. These instances are

         | an alternative expert judgment scale based on national 
         | Collaborators' ratings of parties/coalitions on a scale of their 
         | choice which is related to relevant national political

         | positions on the Left-Right scale: "(1) Civic Passion does not
         | have a clear position in this dimension, so cannot be rated;
         | (2) Proletariat Political Institute's position is rated to be 2;

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - HUNGARY (2018): E5018
         |
         | Collaborators advise that in Hungary, left-right differences are 
         | principally understood in cultural terms and not conventionally.  

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - HUNGARY (2018): E5018_A
         |
         | These data refer to Fidesz - the dominant member of the

         | right classification. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - INDIA (2019): E5018
         | 
         | Collaborators advise that in India, left-right differences do
         | not structure political competition but rather ideological 
         | differences are rooted in bringing several ethnic groups together
         | and the issue of property redistribution. Consequently, 
         | classification of parties/coalitions on this dimension is 
         | challenging.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ITALY (2018): E5018
         |
         | From the Macro Report:
         | - The 5 Star Movement ostensibly classifies itself as "neither 
         | left, nor right", while in fact its platform contains policies 
         | that are both left and right, hence its positioning in the 
         | center.
         | - The League used to be a regional party until the previous 
         | election, it became an anti-immigration party in recent times 
         | (at the end of 2017 it changed the name from "Northern League"
         | to just "League", to appeal to voters in the south as well), and
         | in terms of left-right it is hardly distinguishable from 
         | Brothers of Italy.
         | - A general point: the left-right positions that I chose here 
         | take into account the issues of economic redistribution (where:
         | the 5 Star Movement would be positioned slightly on the left, 
         | given the emphasis on what they call a "universal minimum 
         | income", which is in fact a more generous unemployment benefit;
         | the League and Forza Italia would be positioned on the right, 
         | given their emphasis on introducing a "flat tax"; the Democratic
         | Party would be positioned on the center-left, Free and Equal 
         | would be positioned on the left) and immigration (League and 
         | Brothers of Italy on the right, Democratic Party + Free and 
         | Equal on the left, and 5 Star slightly on the right).
         | - For context, on the right, a few name changes and party splits
         | in the last 10 years deserve some explanation: in 2007, the 
         | parties Forza Italia (of the former Prime Minister Silvio 
         | Berlusconi) and National Alliance (heir of the far-right Italian
         | Social Movement) merged into the People of Freedom (PDL). In 
         | 2012, some former member of National Alliance left the PDL to 
         | form Brothers of Italy. In 2013, Berlusconi re-formed Forza 
         | Italia, so the PDL as a party was extinguished. To a great 
         | extent, the current situation (Forza Italia and Brothers of 
         | Italy running as separate parties albeit in the same coalition)
         | mirrors the pre-PDL arrangement (although, importantly, while 
         | Berlusconi remains the leader of Forza Italia, the current 
         | leader of Brothers of Italy is not the same old leader of 
         | National Alliance).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - LITHUANIA (2016): E5018
         |
         | Collaborators advise that in Lithuania, it is challenging to  
         | classify parties/coalitions on the left-right spectrum, as most
         | parties founded post-2000 do not classify themselves on this
         | axis. Before 2000, party competition structured on a left-right
         | dimension mirrored an ex-communist versus anti-communist 
         | cleavage. 
         | Parties such as the Lithuania Union of Farmers and Greens (LVZS, 
         | PARTY B), the Lithuanian Poles Electoral Action - Christian 
         | Families Alliance (LLRA-KSS, PARTY F) and Party Order and Justice
         | (PTT, PARTY G) take positions on the right of the political 
         | spectrum on moral issues, but take position on the left regarding
         | economic issues. Further, the Labor Party (DP, PARTY H) is  
         | liberal on the moral dimension takes a somewhat contradictory 
         | stance on the economic dimension (combining left-wing and liberal 
         | rhetoric). 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - LITHUANIA (2020): E5018
         |
         | Collaborators advise that in Lithuania, it is challenging to

         | axis. Before 2000, party competition structured on a left-right

         | takes a somewhat contradictory stance on the economic dimension 
         | (combining left-wing and liberal rhetoric). 
         | The Freedom Party and the Liberal Movement are liberal both on 
         | moral and economic dimensions, the former being more radical on 
         | such questions as LGBT rights. Only the Homeland Union - 
         | Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD, PARTY A) and the 
         | Lithuanian Social Democratic Party (LSDP, PARTY D) can be easily 
         | placed on this dimension. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - LITHUANIA (2020): E5018_I
         |
         | Collaborators advise that it is challenging to place this party 
         | as it identifies as a centrist party but embraces right-wing  
         | populism, meaning the party could be classified as score 5
         | or score 9. Score 9 is characterized in the dataset. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - MEXICO (2018): E5018_H

         | Collaborators advise with the COVID-19 pandemic and less salience
         | given over to the immigration issue in the 2021 contest compared
         | to previous Dutch elections, the left-right position of parties
         | were not as consistent as in previous contests with the COVID-19
         | issue acting as "a dampener on outspoken party positions".  

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PORTUGAL (2019): E5018_D

         | These data refer to the Unitary Democratic Coalition (CDU). CDU 
         | is an electoral alliance of the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP)

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - BRAZIL (2018): E5020
         |
         | Collaborators advise Some Brazilian right and left parties 
         | adopted populist discourse during the election campaign (adopting
         | the definition of CSES MODULE 5), although the programmatic scope
         | of most of the parties is not broadly populist.
         | The anti-corruption conjuncture of the political elite strongly
         | contributed to the campaign discourses being directed to the "us
         | against them" equation. This equation also added strength to the
         | anti-petist sentiment, noting that the PT was the party that 
         | occupied the federal government between 2003 and 2016 (President
         | Dilma Rousseff, elected in 2014, was impeached in 2016).
         | Given the definitions of populism used in MODULE 5, the two main
         | parties in contention for the presidency of the Republic - PT 
         | and PSL - can be considered populist, with a significantly
         | populist speech in the 2018 election. The party classification
         | in item 6c largely responds to this assessment of campaign
         | discourse from leaderships.

         | Parties/coalitions and their numerical & alphabetical

         | of the CSES Codebook.

         | E5020_ details the expert judgment of the national Collaborators
         | as to where parties are located on a populism scale. 
         | Definition: Populism can be defined as a thin-centered ideology
         | that pits a virtuous and homogeneous people against a set of 
         | elites and dangerous 'others' who are depicted as depriving
         | "the people" of their rights, values, prosperity, identity, and
         | voice. The emphasis on anti-elite/ anti-establishment rhetoric 
         | and the contrast between the "pure people" and the "corrupt 
         | elite" are thus indications of the degree to which a party is 
         | populist. Populist parties can be found across the left-right 
         | ideological spectrum.
         |
         | Sometimes parties' levels of populism are hard to determine.

         | League uses populist tones, but conjugated in a more national-
         | anthropological sense (the emphasis on the interest of the 
         | "Italians") rather than in an anti-establishment sense (also 
         | because they have been part of the government with Berlusconi
         | in the periods 1994-1995, 2001-2006, and 2008-2011. About Forza
         | Italia, Berlusconi used a slightly populist narrative in the mid

         |
         | A detailed description of the most salient factors
         | in the election as perceived by the Collaborators were:
         |   080. In April 2018, former President Lula was arrested on 
         |        charges of corruption schemes in a process he developed 
         |        in the context of federal police operations called Car 
         |        Wash. His arrest was strongly contested due to procedural
         |        problems. Just weeks before the election, the Worker's 
         |        Party defined as the official candidate for the
         |        presidency of the republic the university professor 
         |        Fernando Haddad. The PT ran for the fourth term in the 
         |        federal government and Lula was the party's main 
         |        candidate name. Even in prison, Lula obtained in the 
         |        polls the average preference of 35% of the voters in the 
         |        preferences for the presidency of the republic.
         |   081. Within a month of the first round of the Presidential 
         |        election, right-wing Social Liberal Party candidate (Jair
         |        Bolsonaro) suffered a knife attack in the middle of an 
         |        election campaign. This event provoked a great commotion 
         |        by political violence, and due to the period of medical 
         |        recovery in the hospital, triggered a virtual campaign 
         |        through social networks through which the candidate 
         |        communicated with the electorate. The recovery made it 
         |        possible for the candidate not to participate in the 
         |        election debates on television, greatly benefiting him.
         |   082. Strong left-to-right polarization (PT vs. PSL). The 
         |        campaign was marked by strong anti-petism (Workers' 
         |        Party), developed mainly through social networks. It is 
         |        important to mention that the political polarization 
         |        began in 2016, with the impeachment of President Dilma 
         |        Rousseff, elected in 2014. Polarization has provoked 
         |        violent situations in rallies and street campaigns, as 
         |        well as in social media channels.
         |   083. Denunciations of scandal and corruption against the
         |        political class, affecting the most important parties of
         |        the party system.
         |   084. Prominent role of social networks used by top candidates,
         |        including the strong use of fake news.

         | The most salient factors in the election as perceived by the 
         | Collaborators were:
         |   204. The Colectiv nightclub fire on October 30, 2015, that led
         |        to the death of 64 people and raised a series of anti-
         |        corruption protests in Romania. As a result, Prime 
         |        Minister Victor Ponta resigned on November 4, 2015. His 
         |        Cabinet (formed by three parties - Social Democratic 
         |        Party, Alliance of Liberals and Democrats, and National
         |        Union for Romania's Progress) was replaced by a

         |        Commissioner Dacian Ciolo?.
         |   205. The Dacian Ciolo? technocratic Cabinet, in office for one 
         |        year prior to the 2016 General Election (November 17, 
         |        2015 - January 4, 2017).
         |   206. The reluctance of Prime Minister Dacian Ciolo? to 
         |        formally associate with the National Liberal Party in the 
         |        electoral campaign.
         |   207. The rise of the Save Romania Union, with roots in the 
         |        civil society, as an anti-system and loudly anti-
         |        corruption political contender.
         |   208. The return to the PR electoral system for the 2016
         |        Parliamentary Elections as a consequence of Law no.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SWITZERLAND (2019): E5021
         |
         | The most salient factors in the election as perceived by the 
         | Collaborators were:
         |   110. Climate change: Public debate on global climate change 
         |        and large mobilizations for numerous events (such as 
         |        school strikes and demonstrations for stricter climate 
         |        protection measures) across the country during the 
         |        election year.
         |   111. Women's strike: National women's strike on 14 June 2019, 
         |        which mobilized hundreds of thousands of women to 
         |        demonstrate against their persisting unequal treatment in
         |        the Swiss society. During the election campaign, several 
         |        trade unions and women's associations called upon parties
         |        to put more women on their lists and upon citizens to 
         |        deliberately vote for women in the federal elections.
         |   112. Old-age pensions: Voters mentioned problems regarding the
         |        welfare state and social insurances as the second most 
         |        important political problem (after climate change). Due
         |        to the aging of the population health costs are 
         |        increasing and a reform of the old-age pension system 
         |        becomes more and more urgent in order to secure pensions
         |        in the future.
         |   113. Relations with EU: Even though the bilateral relationship 
         |        between Switzerland and the EU was not the most salient 
         |        topic during the election campaign, it still made it into
         |        the top 3 of the most important political problems 
         |        according to voters. Especially the debate on the 
         |        institutional framework agreement played an important 
         |        role in the election year.
         |   114. Negative campaigning: There was some media attention when
         |        the SVP unveiled a poster that showed a red apple with a 
         |        Swiss flag being eaten by worms wearing the colors of the
         |        four other main political parties as well as the EU. 
         |        Another event of negative campaigning was the CVP's 
         |        Internet campaign, which criticized the positions of 
         |        candidates from other parties and promoted its own 
         |        candidates.

         |
         | A description of the most salient factors in the election is 
         | included here:
         |   167. One of the candidates, Nabil Karoui, from the 
         |        Presidential elections was held in jail for suspicion of 
         |        financial crimes. He was not allowed to take part in the 
         |        Presidential debates with other candidates. He was 
         |        released when he won the first round. The move was 
         |        considered by media and analysts as a strategy to 
         |        undermine his popularity in the elections (both 
         |        Presidential and legislative). Nabil Karoui was running 
         |        as a candidate in the Presidential but also with his 
         |        party, Kalb Tounes, in the legislative elections.
         |   168. Scandal: Nabil Karoui was found dealing with Canadian 
         |        lobbyist, who is also a former Israeli intelligence 
         |        agent. The deal consisted of a contract of US$ 1million 
         |        to support Karoui's presidency and in return he would 
         |        play the role of a regional peace-maker in the Libyan 
         |        conflict.
         |   169. Death of the President of the country, Beji Caid Essebsi 
         |        in July 2019, which led to a change in the elections' 
         |        dates.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - HONG KONG (2016): E5022
         | 
         | As before, the body administering the election law in Hong Kong 
         | (the Electoral Affairs Commission) largely considered the 2016 
         | LegCo Election as impartial. However, in this election, 
         | there was one incident that led to queries over the body's 
         | impartiality: returning officers under the Electoral Affairs 
         | Commission decided that six persons were not qualified for 
         | running for LegCo on the ground that judging from their past 
         | remarks and social media posts, the disqualified persons 
         | advocated Hong Kong independence, so could not genuinely support
         | the Basic Law (according to which Hong Kong is an inalienable 
         | part of China). Since in previous elections, returning officers
         | had never made this kind of political judgments, some perceived
         | their decisions as political censorship over who could run for 
         | LegCo Election and rejection of the candidacy of some persons on
         | political grounds. (From the Macro Report.)

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CZECHIA (2017): E5023

         | The complaint referred to the design of ballot papers and how
         | preference votes were counted in the election. Ballot papers 
         | contained list of candidates on both sides of the ballot (front
         | and back). However, in several electoral districts, the Electoral
         | Commission did not count the preferential votes on the back page
         | of the ballots. The Supreme Administrative Court ordered a 
         | recount of preferential votes, which resulted in a different

         | Formal complaints against the election results are a common
         | occurrence in Germany, including disputes over ballot layout and
         | and errors in vote tabulation. But two complaints generated 
         | notable coverage in the media. The first was a complaint from 
         | the Alternative for Germany (AfD, PARTY E), which objected to 
         | the Green Party (Buendnis 90/Die Gruenen, PARTY C) gender 
         | balanced slate of candidates for the 2021 election 
         | ("Frauenstatut"), calling them undemocratic. 
         | The second notable complaint was problems with voting in Berlin
         | state with voting plagued with problems including missing or 
         | incorrect ballot papers, polling stations temporarily closed  
         | during voting hours, and other organizational challenges, some 
         | associated with the Berlin Marathon, which was taking place 
         | on the same day, and made voting challenging for some people. 
         | The Federal Election Commissioner submitted an objection due
         | to these challenges.

         | Defeated Presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori (PARTY B, Fuerza
         | Popular, FP) alleged on June 7, 2021, that there was "fraud" at 
         | several rural polling stations, arguing that this made a material
         | difference to the result of the Presidential election and the
         | victory of Pedro Castillo. Fuerza Popular presented 945 
         | complaints regarding the electoral process to the National 
         | Electoral Jury (Jurado Nacional del Eleccionnes, JNE) but most  
         | of the objections were dismissed, and the JNE reaffirmed the 
         | result of the Presidential election. 
         | Some allies of Fuerza Popular continued to cast doubt on the 
         | result and petitioned the Organization of American States (OAS)
         | for an audit of the election results but the request to the OAS

         | The Statement of Preliminary Findings and Conclusions issued on 
         | 14 October concluded that the parliamentary elections were 
         | prepared well, 'but media bias and intolerant rhetoric in the 
         | campaign were of significant concern. While all candidates were
         | able to campaign freely, senior state officials used publicly 
         | funded events for campaign messaging. The dominance of the 
         | ruling party in public media further amplified its advantage. 
         | Election day was orderly, although secrecy of the vote was not 
         | always enforced. Timely publication of preliminary results 
         | ensured transparency'.

         | Elections held Monday-Friday inclusive are classified as weekday

         | of the world, there are some notable exceptions with Sunday-
         | Thursday workweeks (e.g., Israel due to the Shabbat and some

         | Furthermore, data refer to the main election, unless otherwise
         | stated. 
         | CSES classifies the main election based on the regime
         | (executive) type and the election in which the CSES survey has
         | been administered. For polities rated as parliamentary systems,
         | CSES classifies the main election as elections to the lower house
         | for most studies. It deviates for a few cases when elections to
         | the upper house constitutes the main election, usually due to the
         | respective CSES study focusing on the upper house contest.
         | For polities rated as Presidential systems, CSES conventionally
         | classifies the main election as the Presidential election. It
         | sometimes deviates when data for the Presidential election is
         | unavailable (e.g., when the CSES survey was administered in a
         | midterm election). For polities rated as mixed systems, CSES
         | has tended to classify the main election as elections to the
         | lower house. However, it sometimes deviates depending on data
         | availability. Users are advised to consult the table listed in
         | VARIABLE NOTES for E3013_OUTGOV specifying the main election for

         | This was an early election. The 2017 elections were initially

         | an agreement between the PS and PD on 18 May to allow senior

         | the previous election had been held on May 7, 2015, the next
         | election was scheduled for May 2020. 
         | However, Conservative incumbent Prime Minister Theresa May sought
         | an early election to strengthen her mandate for Brexit 
         | negotiations with the EU. Under the Fixed Term Parliament Act, 
         | Parliament can be dissolved for an early election if 2/3 of the 
         | Parliament vote in favor. A House of Commons motion was passed on
         | 19 April 2017 facilitating the early election - supported by 
         | the Conservatives, Labor, the Liberal Democrats, and the Greens, 
         | on a vote of 522-13 (the SNP abstained).

         | Under the Fixed Term Parliament Act, British parliamentary terms

         | Act, Parliament can be dissolved for an early election if 2/3 of 
         | the parliament vote in favor. An election was not anticipated 
         | until May 2022. However, Conservative Prime Minister Theresa 
         | May's failure to get House of Commons support for her Brexit 
         | deal agreed with the European Union in November 2018 saw Britain 
         | fail to leave the Union by March 31, 2019. A disastrous 
         | performance by the Conservative Party in the 2019 European 
         | elections saw the Conservatives slump to fifth place in the 
         | national vote and the Brexit party win the most votes. It forced 
         | Theresa May to resign as Conservative leader and Prime Minister 
         | to be replaced by Boris Johnson, an original Brexit supporter. 
         | Upon assuming office, Mr. Johnson decided to re-open 
         | negotiations with the European Union, but also made three 
         | attempts in the House of Commons for parliament to be dissolved. 
         | All failed to meet the two-thirds threshold required for an 
         | early dissolution, with opposition parties (and some backbench 
         | Conservative MPs) insisting that Mr. Johnson rule out a "no-deal" 
         | UK withdrawal from the EU. Prime Minister Johnson conceded to 
         | keep negotiations with the EU open. Eventually, the government 
         | agreed to a revised withdrawal deal with the European Union in 
         | November 2019. A House of Commons motion was passed on October 
         | 28, 2019, facilitating the early election - 438-20 votes.

         | The current elections were held ahead of time, on October 28,
         | 2017. The 2017 snap elections were triggered by the collapse of
         | the coalition government, when Bright Future left the coalition
         | citing a breach of confidence, following a scandal involving the
         | Prime Minister's father.
         | According to the Macro Report: "The 'restored honor' scandal
         | [Issue 078.] refers to the fact, that the Prime Minister did not
         | inform the leaders of his coalition parties on information he 
         | had concerning 'restored honor' for child-molesters that had 
         | served their prison sentences. Bright Future considered this as

         | (in the Roman calendar October-November). The 2020 elections

         | by the dissolution of the 22nd Israeli Parliament (the Knesset,
         | (elected in September 2019) was March 2, 2020, the day the 
         | election was held. This contest represented the first time
         | in Israeli history that three general elections had been held in

         | In a series of Twitter contributions on July 30, 2020, President
         | Donald Trump (PARTY B) suggested that the election be delayed 
         | due to controversial integrity concerns over states' adoption of 
         | universal mail/absentee voting or mechanisms allowing citizens 
         | to vote early in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The suggestions
         | by President Trump were criticized by Democratic Party (PARTY A)
         | politicians. Leading members of the Republican Party (PARTY B) 
         | rejected the idea, and the election was held as originally 
         | scheduled on November 3, 2020 (although early voting/mail-in
         | voting started before this date).          
         |           
         | While states have the authority to determine the date of primary,
         | the Federal election date in the United States of America is 
         | statutorily set by the Federal Government as "the Tuesday next
         | after the first Monday in the month of November", a law in place
         | since 1845. Article 2 of the United States Constitution empowers
         | the US Congress to choose the timing of the Federal election, 
         | meaning the US President does not have the power to change  
         | the election date without Congressional approval. 
         | A change in the Federal Election date can only occur if the US 
         | Congress (both House and Senate) enacts legislation to this 
         | effect. Even if that were to occur, the US Constitution mandates  
         | that a new Congress takes office on January 3 in the year after 
         | the election, and that a new President's term must begin on 
         | January 20 in the year following the election in accordance with 
         | the 20th Amendment to the US Constitution. In sum, a change in 
         | the Federal election date is possible, but only with 
         | Congressional agreement, and even with that, US constitutional
         | provisions limit the scope for how long any delay could occur.

         | The sporadic violence did not take the form of the government 
         | using state apparatus such as the army and the police. Instead, 
         | the sporadic violence came principally from supporters of 
         | President Trump, including from groups such as the Proud Boys, 
         | a far-right organization. In November and December 2020, after 
         | repeated allegations of electoral fraud and malpractice by 
         | President Trump (PARTY B), there were clashes in the capital 
         | city, Washington D.C., between Trump supporters and counter
         | -protesters. While charges of such electoral malpractice 
         | have not been sustained either through investigations or court 
         | challenges, violence culminated on January 6, 2021, in a rally 
         | held and addressed by President Trump in Washington, D.C., to 
         | coincide with the U.S. Congress' certification of the election 
         | results. After President Trump's speech, some attendees at the 
         | President's rally marched on the U.S. Capitol building, breaking 
         | through law enforcement, occupying the building. The sittings of 
         | both chambers were suspended as politicians and staff were 
         | evacuated from the building. After several hours of a standoff, 
         | where those occupying the building vandalized property and 
         | attacked law enforcement, law enforcement regained control and 
         | ejected protestors from the Capitol. Five people died either 
         | shortly before, during, or following the event. Many protestors 
         | and 138 police were injured. Incumbent President Donald Trump
         | was impeached by the US House of Representatives for a second  
         | time over his role in the events of January 6, 2021, on January 
         | 13, 2021, eight days before leaving office. He was acquitted 
         | in a vote of the US Senate in February 2021, having left office 
         | although a majority of lawmakers (57-43), including seven  
         | Republicans (PARTY B), voted to convict the former President. For

         | all the candidates competing in her district, or alternatively,

         | The Austrian electoral system is a proportional representation

         | allocation of seats passes through each of these levels.
         | However, voters cast a single vote. In this vote, they can
         | express preferences for specific candidates.
         | However, since voters cast a single vote only, this system is
         | different from systems with multiple tiers where voters vote
         | separately in different tiers. Hence, the system is coded as

         | Assembly are elected by the largest remainder method from
         | seven multi-member constituencies, each of which contains between 
         | four and 19 seats. 
         | Parties that reach a quotient are entitled to receive seats. 
         | Seats remaining unfilled by the quotient system are distributed
         | among parties in descending order of their residual votes; 
         | parties that did not attain the sub-quotient are also taken into
         | account, their votes being treated as residual votes.
         | The quotient is the number obtained by dividing the total of 
         | valid votes cast in a particular province by the number of seats
         | to be filled in the same province; the sub-quotient is the total
         | of valid votes cast for a party which, while not attaining the 
         | quotient, obtains or exceeds 50% of it.
         | Voting is compulsory. Party lists were required to alternate

         |
         | In elections in Germany, each voter has two votes, one in each 
         | segment: One vote ("first vote") for an individual candidate in
         | one of the electoral constituencies (tier 1), and another vote
         | ("second vote") for a regional party-list, based on the 16 states

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GREECE (2015 & 2019): E5040_1
         |
         | In the Greek electoral system, representatives are elected
         | according to three methods of counting votes. First, 250
         | representatives are elected proportionally in 56 (59 in 2019
         | election) constituencies.
         | Next, up to 1/20 of the Parliament (currently 12) may be
         | elected not in a specified constituency but throughout the
         | country at large. These are the State Deputies, whose exact
         | number depends on the total electoral strength of each party.
         | Finally, there are 50 'bonus' seats awarded to the party
         | receiving the largest share of the vote.
         | However, since voters cast a single vote only, this system is
         | different from systems with multiple tiers where voters vote
         | separately in different tiers. Hence, the system is coded as
         | consisting of a single tier in variables E5040-E5049.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - HONG KONG (2016): E5040_1 & E5040_2
         |
         | Hong Kong has a unicameral legislature. The Legislative Council
         | of the HKSAR has 70 members. Half of the legislative council is
         | returned by geographic constituency (popular) elections; the
         | other half is returned by functional constituency elections.
         | Election data on Hong Kong electoral institutions refer to the 
         | geographical constituency elections only.
         | In the Geographical Constituency (GC) part of the Election, Hong
         | Kong is divided into five constituencies, and voters elect 
         | candidates by universal suffrage. The number of LegCo seats in 
         | each constituency is decided according to the constituency 
         | population. The voting system adopted is the closed list 
         | proportional representation system. Geographical Constituency is
         | treated here as the first segment of the LegCo.
         | There are two parts of the Functional Constituencies (FCs): the 
         | traditional FCs and the District Council (Second) FC.
         | The traditional FCs return 30 LegCo members. Registration as a 
         | voter in some traditional FCs requires certain qualifications, 
         | for example, registered medical practitioners or dentists for 
         | the Medical FC. Note that in some FCs, voters are individuals, 
         | while in others, 'voters' are not individuals but companies or 
         | organizations.
         | The District Council (Second) FC is treated here as the second 
         | segment of the LegCo. This segment returns 5 LegCo members. In 
         | this part of the election, the whole of Hong Kong has one 
         | constituency only, and the voting system adopted is the closed 
         | list proportional representation system. Candidates must be 
         | elected District Council members who are nominated by no less 
         | than 15 other elected District Council members; whereas voters
         | are registered GC electors who are not registered in other FCs.

         | In elections in Hungary, each voter has two votes, one in each
         | segment: One vote for an individual candidate in one of the 
         | electoral constituencies (tier 1, 106 single-member 
         | constituencies), and another vote (party list vote) for a

         | There is a second tier where 9 (out of 63) so-called 
         | "supplementary" seats are allocated to party lists receiving
         | at least 5% of the valid vote. However, voters cast only a
         | single vote, and voters do not directly cast a vote for
         | this tier. Hence, this variable is coded "97. NOT APPLICABLE". 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - IRELAND (2011): E5040_1

         | Voters have one ballot but can cast as many votes (first 
         | preference and subsequent lower preferences) as there are 
         | candidates running for election. However, a voter is only 
         | required to express a first preference vote for the vote to be 
         | valid with lower preferences optional.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ITALY (2018): E5040
         |
         | Voters could make a sign (1) on the district candidate's name, 
         | (2) on a party list supporting a district candidate, (3) on both
         | the candidate's name and the party list supporting the 
         | candidate. Thus, voters have a vote for both electoral segments
         | (district candidates and party lists). 
         | However, it is important to note that split ballots are not 
         | allowed, which makes the voting system nearly identical as if 
         | voters had a single vote. 
         | Voters residing abroad (3rd segment) vote only for the lists.
         | The same rules apply to both Chambers of the Italian Parliament.

         | Kokkai (National Diet) is a Japanese bicameral parliament. Lower
         | house is Sangiin (House of Councilors), while the Upper house 
         | is Shugiin (House of Representatives).
         | The Lower house (465 directly elected members) consists of two 
         | segments - majoritarian and proportional. The first segment 
         | consists of 289 single-member constituencies, elected via simple 
         | majority voting system. The second segment (proportional) is 
         | based on 11 multi-member (6 to 28 seats) constituencies, in total 
         | giving 176 seats (party list system, using the d'Hondt method 
         | for the allocation of the seats.
         | The Upper House has 242 members. The first segment is 
         | represented by 45 multi-member constituencies (between two and 
         | 12 seats each) for a total of 146 seats (43 formed on a 
         | metropolitan or prefectural basis; and two other constituencies 
         | covering two prefectures each). Successful candidates are 
         | decided in the order of the number of valid votes obtained on 
         | the basis of the comparative plurality. 
         | The second segment is represented by one national constituency
         | for the remaining 96 seats, elected on the basis of party list
         | proportional system. At each election, half of the Upper house 
         | is renewed.

         |
         | In elections in Lithuania, each voter votes in two segments.
         | In the first segment, voters vote for an individual candidate 
         | in one of 71 single-member constituencies. In the second 
         | segment, voters vote for a national party list in a nationwide 
         | multi-member constituency (70 seats). 
         | In the proportional representation tier, voters can cast one  
         | vote for a party list, and they have five preferential votes for  
         | the candidates of the party they have voted for. Hence, for the 
         | second segment, this variable was coded 5.
      
         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - MEXICO (2018): E5040_1 & E5040_2
         |
         | Mexican voters cast a single vote in a single-member district
         | plurality election. However, this also counts for the allocation
         | of the proportional representation seats disputed in the larger 
         | regional multi-member districts (five circumscriptions). Thus, 
         | voters are not allowed to split their vote; in fact, the same 
         | vote is subject to a double counting that produces two-seat 
         | relevant vote totals. The first vote total determines who wins 
         | the plurality in the single-member district (300 seats). The 
         | second serves to allocate seats in the multi-member districts 
         | (200 seats). The PR seats are allocated according to the 
         | aggregate distribution of votes of multi-member districts.
         | For a party to be entitled to have members of proportional
         | representation in the Lower Chamber, it must attain at least
         | 3 percent of the total valid votes cast for these elections. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - MEXICO (2018): E5040_3 & E5040_4
         |
         | For senatorial (Upper House) elections, voters cast a single 
         | vote in 3-seat multi-member districts (which correspond to the
         | country's 31 states plus the Federal District). The first two 
         | seats are awarded to the plurality winner, and the third seat is
         | given to the first runner-up. This vote also counts for the 
         | allocation of proportional representation seats disputed in one
         | national district. Thus, each vote is subject to a double 
         | counting that produces two-seat relevant vote totals. The first
         | vote total determines who wins the in the multi-member districts
         | (96 seats), the second serves to allocate through proportional
         | representation the remaining 32 seats. For the allocation of the
         | PR seats the national distribution of votes excludes nonvalid 
         | votes, votes for parties that obtained less than 3% and votes 
         | for non-registered candidates.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NORWAY (2017): E5040_2
         |
         | The Norwegian Parliament comprises 169 seats in two tiers:
         | 150 members are elected in 19 multi-member districts using
         | proportional representation. The remaining 19 seats are
         | compensatory and are allocated to parties that receive 4%+ of
         | the national vote. These seats are known as "members at large"
         | and are seen as a means of evening out discrepancies between
         | the number of votes received and the number of seats in the
         | Storting. The distribution is based on a comparison of the
         | actual distribution of seats with what would have been occurred
         | had the country been treated as on big constituency, thus
         | allowing a determination to be made as to which parties are
         | under-represented. These parties are then awarded "seats at
         | large" in the constituencies where they were closest to winning
         | an ordinary seat. While voters do not cast a ballot directly for
         | this tier and the seats are awarded at the national level
         | (albeit dispersed at the constituency level), it is widely 
         | acknowledged to constitute a separate tier of the electoral 
         | system.

         |
         | In Switzerland, voters have as many votes as the number of seats
         | in their district (between 1 and 35, depending on the cantons). 
         | Voters can choose one of the parties on the party lists, or they
         | can create their own list by filling an empty list on the ballot 
         | with the candidates they prefer. Moreover, they can modify the
         | party (e.g., add candidates from other parties instead of a
         | candidates of the list [panachage]), delete candidates or vote
         | twice for the same candidate (cumulation).
         | If a voter casts fewer votes than seats in the district, the 
         | remaining votes go to the party indicated on the list. If 
         | no party is indicated, the remaining votes are lost. Since all
         | candidates belong to a party, if a voter casts a single vote for
         | a candidate, that vote automatically counts for that candidate's
         | party list.

         | House of Representatives (Sapha Phuthael Ratsadon) with 500 
         | seats. In the House of Representatives (Sapha Phuthaen 
         | Ratsadon), 350 members are elected by plurality vote in single-
         | member constituencies (1st segment) and 150 members are elected
         | through a closed-list proportional representation system (2nd 
         | segment) to serve 4-year terms.
         | According to the 2017 Constitution, the Lower House uses a new 
         | mixed member apportionment electoral system. Despite there being
         | two separate types of seats to fill in this new system, voters 
         | make only one "fused" choice on the ballot. A voter's mark on 
         | the ballot will now indicate their choice of a constituency 
         | representative and their choice of a political party as the 
         | basis for the distribution of the 150 party list seats. These 
         | decisions were separate under Thailand's previous mixed system. 
         | Distributions of the party list seats are now determined by each
         | party's share of the popular fused vote. The number of single-
         | member seats won are subtracted from the share of all 500 seats
         | a party would receive based on the popular vote. The remainder 
         | is roughly the number of PR seats awarded to that party.

         | an initial screening by the Election Commission of Thailand 
         | (ECT), while the remaining 194 are nominated by the NCPO itself,

         | list, or an independent candidate. Parties can choose to have
         | either an open or a party-ranked list of candidates. If the 
         | list is open, votes that are cast for the party (the voter has 
         | not given a personal vote) are distributed between the candidates
         | based on the number of personal votes. If the list is party- 
         | ranked, a vote cast for the party will be given to the candidate
         | listed first on the list until he or she has received enough 
         | votes to be elected, and so on.

         |
         | The Netherlands uses a multi-member candidate PR-list system with
         | voters presented with a list of candidates on the ballot, with  
         | the name of the party/list placed above the list of candidates.  
         | Consequently, the one vote cast by citizens is one for a 
         | list and candidate simultaneously (sometimes referred to as a 
         | matrix vote). Conventionally, most people vote for the list's 
         | leading candidate, implicitly suggesting they have no particular 
         | preference for a candidate on the list, or indicating they favor
         | the party's top list candidate. That said, some voters cast a
         | preference vote (voorkeurstem) in support of a particular
         | candidate. Candidates receiving 25 percent of the quota can take
         | priority on a party list.                                  

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NORWAY (2017): E5041_2
         |
         | Voters in Norway cast only one single ballot in the election on 
         | the basis of party lists. This vote directly impacts the  
         | selection of the 150 members elected in  the 19 multi-member 
         | districts using proportional representation. However, the ballot
         | also influences the dispersion of the 19 "member at large seats" 
         | (for more SEE ELECTION STUDY NOTES - NORWAY (2017): E5040_2). 
         | As such, when voters are casting their ballot for party lists,
         | they are also casting a ballot, albeit indirectly for the 
         | allocation of the "member at large seats". Accordingly, we code 
         | this as "2. PARTY LISTS".

         |
         | For the Presidential elections, there is only one round of 
         | voting. In most states, for Congressional elections (to the House
         | of Representatives and the Senate), there is also one round of 
         | voting. The exceptions are for House and Senate elections in 
         | Georgia and Louisiana.  
         |
         | In the state of Georgia, winning candidates for all congressional
         | offices must win 50% of the popular vote. Failure to
         | do so results in a run-off election with the two most popular
         | candidates in vote share from the original election advancing 
         | to the run-off contest. This occurred in the 2020 regular (as
         | opposed to special election) Senate election in Georgia when 
         | incumbent Republican (PARTY B) David Purdue lost to Democratic 
         | (PARTY A) challenger Jon Ossoff in the run-off election held in 
         | January 2021. In the original Senate contest in November 2020,  
         | Purdue won more votes than Ossoff, but failed to achieve a 
         | majority support, hence the need for a run-off contest. 
         | For Senate special elections in the state of Georgia, a 
         | non-partisan "jungle primary" operates, where all candidates for 
         | the office, regardless of party affiliation, contest the 
         | election. 
         | A candidate must achieve 50% of the vote to win. If no candidate
         | does, the two most popular candidates in vote share advance 
         | to a run-off election. This occurred in 2020 when incumbent 
         | Republican (PARTY B) Kelly Loeffler, appointed to the seat by 
         | the Republican Governor of Georgia Brian Kemp after the 
         | resignation of long-time Senator Johnny Isakson in late 2019,
         | came second in vote share to Democratic (PARTY A) challenger 
         | Raphael Warnock. Warnock failed to achieve a majority of votes 
         | in the original contest and advanced with Loeffler to a run-off
         | contest in January 2021, in which Warnock defeated Loeffler. 
         |
         | In the state of Louisiana, a "jungle primary" has been used since 
         | 1977. If one candidate obtains a majority of the vote, they
         | win the office they are seeking outright, the only "primary"
         | where a candidate can actually achieve this without a run-off.
         | When a candidate does not win a majority of the vote, the top 
         | two candidates in vote share, irrespective of party,
         | go forward to a run-off election, usually held one month later. 
         | In 2020, incumbent Republican (PARTY B) Bill Cassidy was re-
         | elected, achieving a majority of the vote share in the jungle 
         | primary, negating the need for a run-off contest.

         | express a list of preferences. For example, votes can be cast 
         | by putting a '1' in the column next to the voter's preferred 
         | candidate, a '2' beside their second favorite candidate and 
         | so on. Votes are counted according to the first preferences and
         | any candidates who have achieved the predetermined quota are 
         | elected. To decide which of the remaining candidates are elected
         | the votes are transferred from candidates who have more than the
         | necessary number to achieve the quota and from the candidate with
         | the least number of votes. An example of this is the election in
         | Ireland in 2002.

         Classification of political regimes.

             1. PARLIAMENTARY REGIME

         | VARIABLE NOTES: E5051
         |
         | In CSES MODULE 5, classifications of political regimes mainly 
         | rely on the following decision rule as presented by Cheibub, 
         | 2007:
         | 
         | A. The system is parliamentary either (i) if there is no
         | independently (indirectly or directly) elected President or (ii)
         | if there is an independently (indirectly or directly) elected
         | President but the government is not responsible to the President.
         | B. The system is mixed either if there is an independently
         | (indirectly or directly) elected President and government is
         | responsible to the President.
         | C. The system is Presidential if the government is not 
         | responsible to the elected legislature.
         |
         | NOTE: Responsibility refers to whether the survival of the
         | executive depends directly on legislature (i.e., vote of
         | confidence).
         |
         | However, researchers are advised that in a small number of 
         | cases, coding employed in CSES MODULE 5 may diverge from regime 
         | classifications as suggested by Cheibub. 
         | Further, all polities included in CSES MODULE 5 are classified 
         | according to the above coding scheme, irrespective of their 
         | democratic status. Researchers interested in democracy ratings 
         | may refer to E5090_ (Freedom House) or E5091_ (Polity IV).

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - AUSTRIA (2017): E5051
         |
         | Austrian executive power is coded as mixed or semi-Presidential,
         | given that the President can dissolve the National Council.
         | Article 29 of the Constitution states: 
         | "(1) The Federal President can dissolve the National Council,
         | but he may avail himself of this prerogative only once for the 
         | same reason." However, in practice, the system works mostly
         | like a parliamentary system.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - FINLAND (2019): E5051
         |
         | Classifying the Finish executive power is subject to some 
         | controversy. Here it is coded as a mixed or semi-Presidential 
         | system. Some key features of the Finnish system that distinguish
         | it from a traditional parliamentary system are that by 
         | constitution a) the President is popularly elected by direct 
         | vote for a fixed term of six years and for no more than two 
         | consecutive terms of office; b) the President can, on 
         | recommendation of the Prime Minister, dissolve the legislature; 
         | c) the President can veto legislature, though parliament can 
         | override the Presidential veto with a simple majority; and 
         | d) the President may issue decrees that have the force of law. 
         | More details can be found in Fish & Kroenig, 2009. Nonetheless, 
         | it has been argued that Finland, after constitutional reforms in
         | the 1990s, works in practice as a parliamentary system. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - HONG KONG (2016): E5051
         |
         | Hong Kong is not a sovereign state, but a Special Administrative
         | Region (SAR) in China. The Central Government authorizes the 
         | HKSAR to exercise a high degree of autonomy and enjoy executive, 
         | legislative and independent judicial power. Therefore, the HKSAR
         | Government comparable to a local government.
         | The Chief Executive (CE) is the President of the Executive 
         | Council of Hong Kong and head of the Government of the Hong 
         | Kong Special Administrative Region. The Chief Executive is 
         | elected by an 800-member Election Committee. The elected CE 
         | must then be appointed by the Central People's Government.
         | Regarding the relationship between the CE and Legislative 
         | Council, the type of executive may be regarded as some form of a
         | Presidential system, because the CE and the LegCo members are 
         | returned by different elections. 
         | According to Article 52, the CE must resign in case of refusal 
         | to sign a bill passed by a two-thirds majority of the Legislative
         | Council.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - PORTUGAL (2019): E5051
         |
         | Following Cheibub (2007), Portugal is regarded as 2. MIXED 
         | REGIME in CSES MODULE 5, as Portugal's President is directly 
         | elected and the government is accountable both to parliament  
         | and the President (Article 190 of the constitution).
         | Users are advised that classifying the Portuguese regime type is 
         | subject to some controversy, as the country is sometimes also 
         | regarded as a parliamentary regime.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - TAIWAN (2016 & 2020): E5051
         |
         | Since 1992, the constitution provides for the direct election
         | of a President. Yet, the Executive Yuan (cabinet) is responsible
         | to the Legislative Yuan (parliament) provided that the 
         | Legislative Yuan is in session, its members have the right to 
         | interpolate the President of the Executive Yuan, and Ministers
         | and chairmen of the Commissions of the said Yuan (Article 57 of 
         | the Constitution). However, the legislature cannot vote no
         | confidence in the government and can be dissolved by the 
         | President.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - TURKEY (2018): E5051
         |
         | The constitutional amendments approved in the 2017 Turkish
         | constitutional referendum turned the Presidency into executive
         | post, effective with the 2018 general election. Hence, the
         | Republic of Turkey is a Presidential republic.

         |
         | E5054 details the electoral formula used to elect the President
         | when the President is elected by popular vote. Presidents 
         | indirectly elected (for example, those elected by Parliament) are 
         | classified as "7. NOT APPLICABLE". 
         |
         | Below, the classifications of each electoral formula are 
         | summarized: 
         |    - PLURALITY: The candidate that obtains the most votes wins.
         |    - ABSOLUTE MAJORITY RULE: A candidate must win over 50% of the 
         |      vote to win. If no candidate wins this many votes in  
         |      Round 1, then there is a runoff election (Round 2), 
         |      conventionally between the top two candidates.
         |    - QUALIFIED MAJORITY RULE: Each qualified majority system 
         |      specifies a particular percentage of the vote a candidate 
         |      must win in order to be elected in Round 1. If two or more
         |      candidates overcome these thresholds, then the one with the 
         |      highest number of votes wins. The qualified majority systems 
         |      vary regarding the electoral procedure that applies when 
         |      these thresholds are not met.
         |    - ELECTORAL COLLEGE: The candidate that wins a plurality 
         |      of the electoral college votes wins.
         |    - SINGLE TRANSFERABLE VOTE: Requires voters to rank single
         |      candidates in order of the most to least preferred. Votes 
         |      are transferred until candidates obtain the Droop quota. The
         |      candidate that obtains this quota first is elected. In 
         |      essence, this is the Alternative Vote as only one candidate

         | MAJORITARIAN systems require successful candidates to win either
         | a plurality or majority of the vote. As a result, they are
         | considered majoritarian.
         |
         | PROPORTIONAL systems can be divided into two types: those that 
         | use party lists and those like the single transferable vote that 
         | do not. Those systems employing lists can themselves be divided 
         | into two further categories: quota systems (with allocation of
         | remainders) and highest average systems.
         |
         | MIXED systems use a mixture of majoritarian and proportional
         | electoral rules. A country can be classified as having a mixed
         | system whether it uses one or more electoral segments (tiers); in
         | practice, most mixed systems have more than one segment (tier).
         | Mixed electoral systems can be divided into those in which the
         | two electoral formulas are dependent and those in which they are
         | independent.

         | For parliamentary elections, Costa Rica uses proportional, 
         | closed party list system. The 57 members of the Legislative 
         | Assembly are elected through the largest remainder method from
         | seven multi-member constituencies with between four and 19 
         | seats, which are based on the seven provinces. For the

         | proportional representation, with voting for party lists and,
         | within each list, preferential vote. However, if general

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - IRELAND (2011): E5055
         |
         | The electoral system in Ireland is a proportional
         | representation single transferable vote system (PRSTV). Voters
         | put a '1' beside their most preferred candidate, a '2' beside
         | their second most preferred candidate, and so on. Voters can
         | express as many preferences as there are candidates running in
         | their constituency. On the first count, candidates are declared
         | elected if they attract enough first preference votes to pass a
         | specified threshold, which is defined separately for each
         | constituency according to the formula: [total valid votes/
         | (total number of seats +1) +1]. If a candidate is declared
         | elected on the first count, the second preferences of the
         | candidate's surplus votes (i.e., votes over and above the
         | threshold) are then distributed among the other candidates. If
         | this redistribution does not push any of the remaining
         | candidates over the threshold, the candidate with the lowest
         | number of votes is eliminated, then the second preferences of
         | the eliminated candidate's votes are redistributed. This process
         | of redistribution of surpluses and elimination of candidates
         | continues until all the seats in a given constituency are
         | filled.
         |
         | Owing to the quota formula: [total valid votes/(total number
         | of seats "+1") +1], the STV system in Ireland works similarly
         | as the party-list proportional representation, which uses
         | the largest-reminder method with droop quota. 

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ITALY (2018): E5055

         | Currently, Italy has a mixed-member majoritarian system 
         | consisting of three components. In the majoritarian component,
         | accounting for about 1/3 of the seats, candidates supported by
         | electoral coalitions (or single parties) compete in single 
         | member districts under plurality rule. Approximately 2/3 of 
         | the seats are distributed proportionally among parties according
         | to the results at the national level.

         | Of the 300 members of parliament, 250 are elected proportionally
         | in 56 (59 in 2019) constituencies.
         | According to the Greek Constitution (Article 54.3), part of the
         | Parliament (no more than 1/20) may be elected not in a specified
         | constituency but rather throughout the country at large. These
         | are the State Deputies, whose exact number depends on the total
         | electoral strength of each party.
         | The remaining 50 seats are awarded to the party receiving the
         | largest share of the vote as a 'premium'.
         | However, since voters cast a single vote only, this system is
         | different from systems with multiple tiers where voters vote
         | separately in different tiers. Hence, the system is coded as
         | consisting of three tiers in variable E5056, and of a single
         | tier in variables E5040-E5049.

         | other half is returned by functional constituency elections.
         | Geographical Constituency is treated here as the first segment 
         | of the LegCo.
         | There are two parts of the Functional Constituencies (FCs): the 
         | traditional FCs and the District Council (Second) FC.
         | Only the District Council (Second) FC is based on direct 
         | popular elections. Therefore, it is treated here as the 
         | second segment of the LegCo. This segment returns 5 LegCo 
         | members and was introduced by an electoral reform in 2010.

         |
         | The Norwegian Parliament comprises 169 seats in two tiers:
         | 150 members are elected in 19 multi-member districts using
         | proportional representation. The remaining 19 seats are
         | compensatory and are allocated to parties that receive 4%+ of
         | the national vote. These seats are known as "members at large"
         | and are seen as a means of evening out discrepancies between
         | the number of votes received and the number of seats in the
         | Storting. The distribution is based on a comparison of the
         | actual distribution of seats with what would have been occurred
         | had the country been treated as on big constituency, thus
         | allowing a determination to be made as to which parties are
         | under-represented. While voters do not cast a ballot directly 
         | for this second tier and the seats are awarded at the national
         | level (albeit dispersed at the constituency level), the tiers 
         | are considered linked because a voter casts only one ballot for 
         | both tiers and the fact that allocation of the 19 additional  
         | seats in part depends on how many seats are won by a party list
         | in the first tier.

         |
         | The Austrian electoral system is a (non-mixed) proportional
         | representation system with three segments or tiers. These
         | correspond to the federal level tier, the Land level tier (or
         | state level) and the regional districts tier. Counting and
         | allocation of seats passes through each of these levels, and
         | as a consequence is a three-step process. In first place in each
         | Laender a Hare quota is calculated and used to distribute seats
         | across the regional districts. That is, parties are allocated
         | seats from each regional district depending on how often they
         | exceeded the Land level specified quota. Followed by these seats
         | are allocated at the Land level tier, also following the Land
         | level quota. Finally, at the national level seats are
         | distributed following the D'Hondt system. Seats that have been
         | already allocated in the first and second tiers are deducted
         | from the number of seats each party obtains at the national
         | level. Only those parties that obtain more than 4% of the
         | national valid votes or one seat from the regional
         | constituencies qualify to receive seats from the Laender and
         | National seat distribution. Given this last element the
         | electoral system is coded as linked.

         | In Mexico, each voter's vote is counted twice; once for the
         | single member district contest, and a second time for the 
         | regional PR contest (SEE ELECTION STUDY NOTES - MEXICO (2018):
         | E5040_1 & E5040_2 for details).
         | This means that split ballots are not possible. So it could
         | be argued that the segments are linked, although the seat 
         | distribution in different segments is not strictly conditional 
         | on the seats received in another segment (tier).

         |
         | The two tiers are linked with the "second vote" for the national
         | party list (tier 2) acting as a compensatory mechanism to tier 1 
         | ("constituency vote"), ensuring that the total number of seats 
         | each party wins is nearly proportional to its total vote. Tier 2 
         | seats are allocated through a national party list using
         | proportional representation based on the Sainte-Lague Formula.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SOUTH KOREA (2016): E5057
         | 
         | In Korea's mixed electoral system, seats of both tiers are 
         | allocated separately; each party is allocated its proportionate
         | share of the PR seats plus the SMD seats won by its candidates.
         | Thus, its segments are classified as not being linked.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - SWEDEN (2018): E5057
         |
         | There are 39 supplementary seats which are distributed to ensure
         | proportionality. Having aggregated the seats for each party in 
         | each constituency (310 seats in total), a new distribution of  
         | seats is conducted, based on the total votes for each party at  
         | the national level. As such, the 39 supplementary seats are  
         | allocated to ensure the result is as close as possible to 
         | the proportional result nationally.

E5058       >>> DEPENDENT FORMULAE IN MIXED SYSTEMS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Whether the two electoral formulas used in a mixed system are 
         dependent or independent.

         | Definition: A dependent mixed system is one in which the 
         | application of one formula is dependent on the outcome produced
         | by the other formula. An independent mixed system is one in which
         | the two electoral formulas are implemented independently of each 
         | other.
         | The definition of E5058 is taken from Matt Golder's database 
         | about Democratic Electoral Systems Around the World, 1946-2011
         | (http://mattgolder.com/elections; Date accessed: April 05, 2019).
         |
         | E5058 primarily concerns the Lower House election. However, if a
         | particular study is focused on the Upper House or Presidential
         | election, it may report results for these elections,
         | respectively.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - ITALY (2018): E5058
         |
         | The application of the formulae in the two electoral tiers is 
         | mutually independent. However, the voting system does not 
         | allow split-ticket voting, so the election outcome in the two
         | segments are closely connected.

         | E5040_1 & E5040_2 for details).
         | Hence, Mexico's mixed electoral system is classified as 
         | independent because the formulas are applied independently 
         | although they are based on the single vote.

         | SUPERPOSITION: This is a system in which a majoritarian and
         | proportional formula are applied in independent electoral
         | districts.
         | 
         | FUSION: This is a system in which majoritarian and proportional
         | formulas are used in an independent manner within a single

         | 
         | CORRECTION: This is a system in which seats distributed by
         | proportional representation in one set of districts are used to
         | correct the distortions created by the majoritarian formula in

         | The 600 members of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey 
         | are elected by party-list proportional representation in 
         | 87 multi-member electoral districts. 
         | The electoral districts correspond to 77 of Turkey's 81
         | provinces. Due to their large populations, the provinces of
         | Bursa and Izmir are divided into two districts, while the
         | provinces of Ankara and Istanbul are each divided into three.

         | In Parliamentary elections (Upper and Lower House), the 
         | Uruguayan electoral system is called Multiple Simultaneous Vote.
         | Each voter votes simultaneously for a party and a closed and 
         | blocked list of candidates. On a single sheet of paper, the 
         | voter votes for the same party for the President of the 
         | Republic, Upper House, and Lower House. Each party must have 
         | only one Presidential candidate and may have multiple lists 
         | for each chamber.
         | For the distribution of seats between the parties, for both 
         | chambers, the relevant constituency is the national one. For 
         | the distribution of seats for the Lower House within each 
         | party, the constituency is by the department.

         | preference among all the candidates contesting the same seat.
         | A candidate is elected if he/she gains an absolute majority or

         | Assembly are elected through the largest remainder method from
         | seven multi-member constituencies with between four and 19 
         | seats, which are based on the seven provinces. For the

         | Slovakia uses the Hagenbach-Bischoff method to distribute seats,
         | a variant of the D'Hondt system. An electoral quota is 
         | calculated by dividing the total number of valid votes won 
         | by lists eligible for seats by the number of seats on offer plus
         | one (i.e., 150+1=151). The number of votes polled by each party
         | that surpasses the threshold is divided by the quota 
         | (with any fractional remainder disregarded), and this gives 
         | the number of seats each party is entitled to. Any seats that 
         | remain unallocated after the application of this procedure 
         | are distributed according to the largest remainder method.

         | are distributed on the basis of the total number of votes gained
         | by the political parties in each constituency. Comparative 
         | numbers are calculated for the parties that will take part in 
         | the distribution of seats. The first comparative number is 
         | obtained by dividing the parties' respective total number of 
         | votes by 1.4. The party which receives the highest comparative 
         | number is awarded the first seat in the constituency. That party
         | is then allocated a new comparative number, obtained by dividing
         | the party's votes by 3. The other parties keep their comparative
         | numbers until they are awarded a seat. When a party obtains its
         | second seat, its votes are divided by 5 to calculate the next
         | comparative number. For the third seat by 7 etc. This method of

         | While a plurality of votes is sufficient in 48 states and the
         | District of Columbia, in the states of Georgia and Louisiana, 
         | candidates need a majority of the vote to win. 
         | In special elections in Georgia and all elections in Louisiana 
         | a "jungle primary" operates (it operated in Louisiana since 1977)
         | The system employed is akin to the first round of a majority
         | run-off election system, whereby all candidates for an office 
         | regardless of party affiliation, run against one another in one
         | election. If one candidate obtains a majority of the vote, they
         | win the office they are seeking outright, the only "primary"
         | where a candidate can actually achieve this without a run-off.
         | When a candidate does not win a majority of the vote, the top 
         | two candidates, irrespective of party, go forward to a run-off
         | election, usually held one month later.

         | The Bundestag nominally has 598 members: 299 members elected at  
         | the lower tier and 299 members elected in the upper tier. The 
         | German system, however, allows for overhang and leveling 
         | seats. In the 2017 elections, there were 111 of these which
         | resulted in a total number of 709 members of the Bundestag.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - GERMANY (2021): E5072
         |
         | Theoretically, the Bundestag comprises of 598 seats. Half
         | of the members (299) members are elected in single-member
         | districts using the first past the post electoral system
         | (the "first vote"). The remaining 299 seats are filled by
         | proportional representation using the party list (the "second
         | vote"). These seats are distributed according to the Saint
         | Lague method.
         | Seat allocation between tier 1 and tier 2 is linked. When
         | parties/blocs win sufficient seats in tier 1 (single member  
         | districts, "first vote") to qualify for allocation of seats in 
         | tier 2 (list vote, "second vote"), despite failing to meet the 
         | tier 2 threshold (in Germany's case, 5% of the list vote), the
         | allocation of these seats to a party/bloc creates what are 
         | colloquially known as "overhang seats". Accordingly, and to      
         | ensure a proportional allocation between the share of votes and 
         | share of seats nationwide, compensatory seats (sometimes      
         | referred to as leveling seats) are also allocated.   
         | In the 2021 Bundestag elections, there were 138 compensatory
         | seats, resulting in the size of the Bundestag being 736, the
         | largest in its history.

         | different blocs are often reported differently by each state.

         | VARIABLE NOTES: E5085_
         |
         | E5085_ detail the reproduction rate (R value) for COVID-19 at 
         | five time periods from the date of the election: four days before
         | the election (T-4 days); seven days before the election 
         | (T-7 days); fourteen days before the election (T-14 days); 
         | twenty-eight days before the election (T-28 days); and three 
         | months before the election (T-91 days).

         | Definition: A pandemic is an epidemic of infectious disease that 
         | has spread across a large region or multiple or worldwide and 
         | affecting a substantial number of individuals.   
         | At the time of writing, COVID-19 was first discovered in November
         | 2019. However, it is possible human-to-human transmission of the
         | disease was occurring before this discovery. On January 11, 2020
         | the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified by Chinese
         | authorities of a virus outbreak in Wuhan, China. On January 30,
         | 2020, the World Health Organization classified COVID-19 as a 
         | Public Health Emergency of Concern before eventually declaring 
         | the Health situation as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
         | 
         | E5085_ details the reproduction rate (R value) of COVID-19 
         | infections in a polity as reported by national health authorities
         | on a particular day relative to the date of the election. The 
         | reproduction rate (R) indicates how fast COVID-19 is spreading 
         | among a population. The number indicates how many people are
         | infected on average by a person who carries the virus.
         | If the R value is greater than 1.0, then it is anticipated the
         | number of infections will keep increasing. If the R value is 
         | lower than 1.0, the disease will eventually stop spreading, 
         | as fewer new infections will develop.

         | Each country and territory is assigned a numerical rating, on a

         | Definition: E5092 details the World Bank estimate of the 
         | distribution of income among individuals or households within an 
         | economy and the extent to which it deviates from a perfectly
         | equal distribution. A Lorenz curve plots the cumulative 
         | percentages of total income received against the cumulative 
         | number of recipients, starting with the poorest individual or 
         | household. The Gini index measures the area between the Lorenz 
         | curve and a hypothetical line of absolute equality. Thus a Gini 
         | index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 
         | implies perfect inequality.

         |
         | In CSES IMD, each party/coalition receives a unique numerical

         | contains information on the polity and a unique numerical value

         | For more detailed information on how CSES codes

         | Users are advised that appending the CSES MODULE 5 dataset to 
         | CSES IMD requires renaming E6000_ variables in accordance with
         | IMD naming conventions first. 
         | In what follows, we provide example syntax on how appending 
         | can be achieved in STATA: 
         |
         | ** // RENAMING E1005 ID VARIABLE AND E6000_ VARIABLES ACCORDING

         |
         | E6000_ detail respondents' vote choice in the current election -
         | if applicable and respondents cast a ballot - based on 
         | harmonized numeric identification codes applied in the CSES 
         | Integrated Module Dataset (IMD), a CSES data product including
         | data from all four completed CSES Modules. 
         |
         | By coding vote choice according to IMD standards, E6000_ 
         | variables thus ease appending the current version of CSES
         | MODULE 5 to the CSES IMD and thereby facilitate longitudinal
         | comparative research. 
         |
         | In CSES IMD, each party/coalition receives a unique numerical 
         | identifier that is consistent across modules. This seven-digit 
         | numerical identifier, on which coding for E6000_ is based, 
         | contains information on the polity and a unique numerical value 
         | to distinguish the party/coalition. Hence, numerical party/
         | coalition codes are harmonized across Modules within CSES IMD.  
         | For more detailed information on how CSES codes 
         | parties/coalitions, please see Part 3 of the CSES IMD Codebook.
         |
         | The harmonized and consistent codes for parties/coalitions are 
         | detailed in Part 3 of the CSES IMD Codebook. Users can search for 
         | the following term: "CSES IMD HARMONIZED PARTY/COALITION 
         | NUMERICAL CODES". 
         |
         | The corresponding variables to E6000_ in the CSES IMD are: 
         | E6000_PR_1:   IMD3002_PR_1
         | E6000_PR_2:   IMD3002_PR_2

         | E6000_LH_DC:  IMD3002_LH_DC
         |   
         | Codes are provided in E6000_LH_DC for parties that are assigned  
         | a harmonized IMD numeric party code by the CSES and for polities  
         | which are at least represented once in the CSES IMD. 
         | Parties that are not represented in the IMD and have thus not

         | Users are advised that appending the CSES MODULE 5 dataset to 
         | CSES IMD requires renaming E6000_ variables in accordance with
         | IMD naming conventions first. 
         | In what follows, we provide example syntax on how appending 
         | can be achieved in STATA: 
         |
         | ** // RENAMING E1005 ID VARIABLE AND E6000_ VARIABLES ACCORDING 
         | **    TO IMD STANDARDS
         |
         | rename E1005 IMD1005
         | rename E6000_PR_1 IMD3002_PR_1
         | rename E6000_PR_2 IMD3002_PR_2
         | rename E6000_LH_PL IMD3002_LH_PL
         | rename E6000_LH_DC IMD3002_LH_DC
         |
         | ** // SAVING MODULE 5 DATASET
         | save "cses5.dta", replace
         |
         | ** // APPENDING CSES MODULE 5 DATASET TO CSES IMD
         | use "cses_imd.dta", clear
         | append using "cses5.dta"
         |
         | ** // END OF EXAMPLE CODE 
         |
         | Further, users should note that upon appending the CSES MODULE 5
         | dataset to IMD, code "9999980. CSES IMD NUMERIC PARTY CODE NOT
         | ASSIGNED YET" will not be labeled yet, as this code was newly
         | introduced in E6000_ and has hence not been envisaged for IMD.
