FULL RELEASE [dataset and documentation]. July 25, 2023 version.
doi:10.7804/cses.module5.2023-07-25. 

These materials are based on work supported by the American National
Science Foundation (www.nsf.gov) under grant numbers SES-1420973 and
SES-1760058, the GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, 
the University of Michigan, in-kind support of participating election 
studies, the many organizations that sponsor planning meetings and 
conferences, and the numerous organizations that fund national 
election studies by CSES Collaborators.

Any opinions, findings and conclusions, or recommendations expressed
in these materials are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily
reflect the views of the funding organizations.

===========================================================================

NOTE TO USERS:

We recommend that researchers become familiar with the CSES design, units 
of analysis, documentation, and dataset weights before beginning their 
investigations. For instance, while the set of respondents appearing within
each election study represents their respective nations, the group of 
nations that appear within CSES is not a random sample of countries 
worldwide. Furthermore, while many election studies include 1,000 or so 
respondents, other election studies may consist of over 10,000 respondents. 
Some nations will have studies of more than one election in a CSES module,
and occasionally there will be two independent studies of a single 
election. Last, some election studies include oversamples of specific 
subpopulations or would otherwise benefit from use of the included weight
variables. We hope you find our website and documentation useful as you 
proceed with your work, and welcome any questions or suggestions you have.

))) OVERVIEW OF "CODEBOOK PART 3: PARTIES & LEADERS"
===========================================================================

Part 3 of the CSES Codebook identifies the parties/coalitions participating 
during a polity's national election and/or those participating in the 
polity's previous national election. It also details the leaders of 
parties/coalitions and/or Presidential candidates (where applicable) 
for the most important parties/coalitions.
Part 3 also lists the party identifiers in other comparative projects, 
namely the Manifesto Research on Political Representation (MARPOR, formerly
the Comparative Manifesto Project) and the Parliament and Government 
(ParlGov) database. This will allow easy data bridging between CSES and 
these other projects.


===========================================================================
))) HOW TO NAVIGATE THE CSES MODULE 5 CODEBOOK
===========================================================================

In the CSES MODULE 5 dataset, all variables begin with the letter "E" 
(E being the fifth letter of the English alphabet and thus signifying 
MODULE 5).

The CSES codebook is especially extensive and users are advised that the 
best way to navigate it is electronically. It is a .txt format which 
allows it to be accessed via a variety of programs. 

The CSES Codebook can be navigated quickly in the electronic files, with 
the following commands allowing for quick searching:

))) = Section Header 

>>> = Sub-section Header 1

<<>> = Sub-section Header 2 

+++ = Tables

CSES QUESTION CLASSIFICATION = For survey level variables only, CSES  
Question Classification details whether the variable is part of the CSES  
Core component, which are questions asked repeatedly in CSES Modules, 
whether a variable is part of the CSES Module Theme component, which are  
questions specific to the Module Theme under exploration and might not be 
included in CSES repeatedly, or whether a variable is a Derivative Variable, 
which is explained below. 

VARIABLE NOTES = Notes for particular variables 

ELECTION STUDY NOTES = Notes for a particular election study  

DERIVATIVE VARIABLE = Highlights a variable derived from another 
variable or variables within the CSES.

POTENTIAL POLITY LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging at polity level.

POTENTIAL REGIONAL LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging at regional level.

POTENTIAL TIME BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging by time.

POTENTIAL PARTY/COALITION LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = Highlights a variable 
that may be used for data bridging at party/coalition level.

POTENTIAL CSES PRODUCT BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = Highlights a variable 
that may be used for data bridging with other CSES products.

For further details on the CSES MODULE 5 documentation, users are advised
to consult Part 1 of the CSES Codebook. 

  
===========================================================================
))) CSES MODULE 5 CODING OF PARTIES/COALITIONS & LEADERS
===========================================================================

CSES codes parties/coalitions in its dataset numerically and
alphabetically. Below we provide explanations of both of these coding
schemes. The details of each party/coalition/leader classification are 
available in Part 3 of the Codebook. 

<<>> CSES NUMERICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING

Each party is assigned a unique numerical code which consists of two 
components and six digits in total:
    - the first three digits indicate the numerical country UN code
    - the latter three digits indicate the numerical party code within
      the given election study.

All parties/coalitions or Presidential candidates, where applicable,
participating in the election or the previous election receive a numerical
code. These codes are used to identify the following: 
    - who respondents feel best represented by (variable E3010_2).
    - who a respondent voted for in the current election 
      (variable E3013).
    - who the respondent voted for in the previous election 
      (variable E3015).
    - the respondent's party identification (variable E3024).
      
The numeric coding is also used to identify macro level information about
the parties/coalitions, namely: 
    - numeric party code identifiers for Parties A-I (E5000)
    - which party/coalition held the Presidency before and after the
      elections (variable E5009 and E5013).
    - which party/coalition held the Prime Ministership before and after
      the elections (variable E5010 and E5014).
     
Numerical codes assigned to parties/coalitions are consistent for the 
current and previous election in most instances. 

<<>> CSES ALPHABETICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING
 
Parties A through F are the six most popular parties/coalitions, ordered in
descending order of their share of the popular vote in the parliamentary 
election (unless otherwise stated). Thus Party A is the party/coalition
that received the most votes in the election, party B the second most
votes, etc...

Parties/coalitions who achieve at least 1% of the vote nationally are
eligible for an alphabetical A-F assignment. In polities with multiple
electoral tiers and where one vote is cast, parties are ordered according
to their vote share in tier 1 (the lowest tier), unless otherwise stated.
In polities where voters have two votes (i.e.: a constituency and a list
vote) simultaneously, for example Germany, parties are ordered by the
national share of the party list vote (tier 2) unless stated otherwise.

Parties G, H, and I are supplemental parties. They may, but do not have to,
accord with how parties A-F are ordered, that is ordered on the popular 
share of the vote in a country. More often, they are codified in no 
particular order. These parties are voluntarily provided by each country's
election study and often reflect important or notable parties within a 
country. They may also include data about individual parties within a 
coalition, where data about the coalition and the individual parties, 
or some of these parties that make it up, are provided.
These codes are used to identify the following in the micro component of 
the CSES dataset: 
    - Respondent's likeability of the party/coalition (variable E3017).
    - Respondent's left-right placement of the party/coalition (variable 
      E3019).

These alphabetical codes are used to identify district and macro level
information about these said parties/coalitions, namely:
    - The said party/coalition's vote share in the respondent's electoral
      district (variable E4004).
    - the said party/coalition's share of the seats in the election in the
      respondent's electoral district (variable E4005)
    - the said party/coalition's share of the vote in the election 
      (variable E5001, E5003, and E5005).
    - the said party/coalition's share of the seats in the election 
      (variable E5002 and E5004).
    - the said party/coalition's share of cabinet portfolios before and 
      after the election (variable E5011 and E5015).
    - expert judgments by the national Collaborators of the said party/
      coalition's ideological family (variable E5017).
    - expert judgments by the national Collaborators of the said party/
      coalition's left-right placement (variable E5018).
    - expert judgments by the national Collaborators of the said party/
      coalition's level of populism (variable E5020).
    - The said party/coalition's Manifesto Research on Political 
      Representation (MARPOR/CMP) Identifier (variable E5200).
    - The said party/coalition's Parliaments and Government Database
      (ParlGov) Identifier (variable E5201).
    - The said party/coalition's Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES) 
      Identifier (variable E5202).
    - The said party/coalition's Party Facts Identifier (variable E5203).
 
<<>> CSES ALPHABETICAL LEADER CODING
         
Leaders A through F tend to be the leaders of the six most popular parties/
coalitions or the Presidential candidates of these parties. They correspond
to parties A-F (i.e.: Leader A will be related to Party A in some way,
Leader B will be related to Party B, etc.).

Leaders G, H, and I are supplemental leaders. They may be related to
parties G, H, I but they do not have to be. These leaders are voluntarily
provided by each polities election study and often include data about
additional personalities of interest. For example, in a parliamentary
system, data about a President might be provided, even if the Presidency
is not being contested. On many occasions, slots Leader G, H, and I will
include additional data for parties/coalitions that have multiple leaders.
These codes are used to identify the following in the micro and macro
components of the CSES dataset: 
    - Respondent's likeability of the leader/personality in question
      (variable E3018).


===========================================================================
))) PARTIES/COALITIONS & LEADER CLASSIFICATIONS FOR CSES MODULE 5 BY POLITY 
    & ELECTION YEAR
===========================================================================

All parties/coalitions or Presidential candidates, where applicable, 
participating in the election or the previous election receive a 
numerical code. Alphabetical codes are assigned to select parties and 
leaders (see above description on how parties/coalitions and leaders are
coded by the CSES). 

The party/coalition and leaders are listed in numerical order. CSES 
provides the name of the party/coalition in the original language, the 
English version of the party/coalition name, and the party abbreviation, 
where available. Leaders are only listed for parties where we have 
accompanying leader likeability data available. Polities are listed in 
alphabetical order. The party/coalition and leaders are listed in numerical 
order. 

Users are advised to pay particular attention to ELECTION STUDY NOTES 
listed below each polity's party and leader list for additional information
regarding data availability and deviations.

         | ELECTION STUDY NOTES - CHILE (2017): PARTIES & LEADERS
         |
         | LEADERS A-I were the Presidential candidates of their respective 
         | parties or coalitions.
         | Even though voters in Chile cast votes for candidates in an open
         | list proportional system, coalitions play an important role in 
         | the work of parliament and government formation. Some 
         | respondents reported voting for an electoral coalition or for an 
         | Independent candidate affiliated with the electoral coalition.
         | These respondents are coded as voting for the coalition, and 
         | that is the reason why coalitions are assigned a separate 
         | numerical code.           
         |
         | The alphabetical classifications between parties/coalitions and 
         | leaders do not align in all instances as there was additional
         | relational data available for candidates contesting the 
         | Presidential elections. This applies to LEADERS E, G, H, and I.

         | NUMERICAL CODE 152089: Jose Antonio Kast (LEADER E) was a

         | Below, all seven alliances forming for the 2017 election are 
         | listed, with parties constituting them.
         | The numerical classification of alliances are arbitrary and 
         | denoted by CSES for the ease of users. Researchers are advised 
         | that the first four alliances denote the major alliances in 
         | support of a Presidential candidate. Where applicable, an * 
         | indicates the dominant member(s) of the alliance.

         | due to time restrictions, the Supreme Court could not approve 
         | its participation. Therefore, Bukele decided to run as a 
         | candidate of GANA.

         |
         | One alliance formed in the 2016 Irish parliamentary election:
         |
         | PARTY E (Anti-Austerity Alliance-People Before Profit, AAA-PBP, 
         | NUMERICAL CODE 372005) with the following parties contesting as 
         | part of this alliance:
         | - Anti-Austerity Alliance (AAA), NUMERICAL CODE 372011.
         | - People Before Profit (PBP), NUMERICAL CODE 372012.
         | - Anti-Water Tax Socialist Party (SP).
         |
         | NUMERICAL CODE 372011: Anti-Austerity Alliance and 372012.
         | People Before Profit are only used for classifying respondents'
         | party identification (variable E3024_3). For all other variables, 
         | code 372005 for the alliance is used. Researchers are advised 
         | that the forerunner of the AAA-PBP alliance was known as 
         | "United Left Alliance", a name that was abandoned in 2013.
         | The alliance operated under a collective leadership. Listed as 
         | LEADER E is Richard B. Barrett (PBP) who represented the alliance
         | in a television debate before the election. 
         |
         | PARTY F (The Social Democrats, SD), officially had three 
         | leaders. Listed as LEADER F is Stephen Donnelly, who represented 
         | the alliance in a television debate before the election. 
         |
         | The code 999989 for Independent Candidates also includes 
         | those respondents who reported to have voted for the Independent
         | Alliance (IA) in variable E3013_LH_DC (N=3). The IA was 
         | comprised of a grouping of independent politicians and was 
         | formed in 2015 but is not formally registered as a political 
         | party (and hence, is not assigned a party/coalition  
         | alphabetical code) and does not employ the whip system. Some of 
         | its members are currently participating in the government 
         | formed after the 2016 elections with PARTY A, Fine Gael (FG).
         |
         | Data is unavailable for PARTY H (Renua Ireland, RI) for variables
         | E3017_H, E3019_H, E5017_H, E5018_H and E5020_H.

         | LEADERS A, B, and E were the Presidential candidates of their
         | respective parties/coalitions in the Presidential Election.
         |
         | NUMERICAL CODE 158120: PAN-Green is a localist political 
         | coalition in Taiwan, consisting of the following parties:
         | - Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), PARTY A, NUMERICAL CODE 
         |   158101. 
         | - Taiwan Statebuilding Party (TSP), PARTY F, NUMERICAL CODE

         | comprising parties that approve of Taiwanese independence. 
         | Hence, this code is used for classifying variable E3024_3. 
         |
         | NUMERICAL CODE 158130: The Minkuotang (MKT), also known as the 
         | Republican Party, was part of the Pan-Blue Coalition  which

))) PARTY IDENTIFIERS FROM OTHER COMPARATIVE STUDIES 
===========================================================================

For all parties/coalitions that are assigned an alphabetical classification
in CSES MODULE 5, CSES provides identifiers from four other comparative
projects, namely the Manifesto Research on Political Representation (MARPOR,
formerly the Comparative Manifesto Project, CMP) Project, the
Parliament and Government (ParlGov) Database, the Chapel Hill Expert Surveys
(CHES), and the Party Facts Database.
 
Below, we list the identifiers assigned by each project to a party/coalition
included in CSES MODULE 5 and which have been assigned an alphabetical
classification. This allows for data bridging between CSES MODULE 5 and
these datasets at the party/coalition level.
 
Data are listed in CSES Codebook Part 3 only for polities and
parties/coalitions where information is available in the accompanying
dataset. When unavailable for a polity or party/coalition, this is listed
in the CSES MODULE 5 dataset as "999999. NOT AVAILABLE IN MANIFESTO RESEARCH
ON POLITICAL REPRESENTATION PROJECT" or "9999. NOT AVAILABLE ..." for all
other projects. In the documentation below, when data is unavailable for a
particular party/coalition in a polity/study where data is mostly available,
it is listed as "999999" or "9999". In cases where data is unavailable for
all parties/coalitions for a particular polity/study, there is no
corresponding documentation entry below. 
 
Polities are listed in alphabetical order. Parties/coalitions are listed in
order of their A-I assignment in each polity. In circumstances where there
are multiple elections that are included in MODULE 5 for one polity,
parties/coalitions are first listed according to alphabetical assignment for
the first election study in question.

         |
         | The Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) and Dialogue for Hungary 
         | formed an electoral alliance in the 2018 legislative election. 
         | For this contest, MARPOR/CMP, CHES and Party Facts do not include
         | data on the alliance. Instead, individual parties are classified. 
         |
         | MARPOR/CMP data for these parties for this contest is available 
         | under codes:
         | - 86220 (MSZP)
         | - 86111 (Dialogue for Hungary)
         |
         | CHES data for these parties for this contest is available under
         | codes:       
         | - 2301 (MSZP)
         | - 2312 (Dialogue for Hungary)
         |
         | Party Facts data for these parties for this contest is available 
         | under codes:       
         | - 1408 (MSZP)
         | - 3115 (Dialogue for Hungary)
         |
         | Dialogue for Hungary and "Together" formed an electoral alliance
         | in the previous 2014 legislative election. CMP/MARPOR does not
         | award a separate code for "Together" for the 2018 election, but
         | continues using the alliance code 86340, reported in the table
         | above. As the vote share reported by CMP/MARPOR (0.66%) matches  
         | the election result for "Together" in 2018, CSES assumes that
         | data reported under code 86340 refer to "Together" in 2018 rather
         | than the alliance.
