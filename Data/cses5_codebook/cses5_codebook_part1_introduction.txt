These materials are based on work supported by the American National
Science Foundation (www.nsf.gov) under grant numbers SES-1420973 and
SES-1760058, the GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, 
the University of Michigan, in-kind support of participating election 
studies, the many organizations that sponsor planning meetings and 
conferences, and the numerous organizations that fund national 
election studies by CSES Collaborators.

Any opinions, findings and conclusions, or recommendations expressed
in these materials are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily

===========================================================================

NOTE TO USERS:

We recommend that researchers become familiar with the CSES design, units 
of analysis, documentation, and dataset weights before beginning their 
investigations. For instance, while the set of respondents appearing within
each election study represents their respective nations, the group of 
nations that appear within CSES is not a random sample of countries 
worldwide. Furthermore, while many election studies include 1,000 or so 
respondents, other election studies may consist of over 10,000 respondents. 
Some nations will have studies of more than one election in a CSES module,
and occasionally there will be two independent studies of a single 
election. Last, some election studies include oversamples of specific 
subpopulations or would otherwise benefit from use of the included weight
variables. We hope you find our website and documentation useful as you 
proceed with your work, and welcome any questions or suggestions you have.

))) OVERVIEW OF "CODEBOOK PART 1: INTRODUCTION"
===========================================================================

Part 1 of the Codebook provides an extensive overview of the CSES MODULE 5
study. It includes general details about the project, the project's 
governing board (the Planning Committee), and information on the national 
Collaborators who administered CSES MODULE 5 in their national election 
study. 

Further, extensive information about how to access CSES data, CSES 
documentation, and CSES coding conventions are also provided. In addition, 
an overview of the sampling procedures and weights of each polity's study 
as well as a project bibliography are also detailed in this section. 


===========================================================================
))) HOW TO NAVIGATE THE CSES MODULE 5 CODEBOOK
===========================================================================

In the CSES MODULE 5 dataset, all variables begin with the letter "E" 
(E being the fourth letter of the English alphabet and thus signifying 
MODULE 5).

The CSES Codebook is especially extensive and users are advised that the 
best way to navigate it is electronically. It is a .txt format which 
allows it to be accessed via a variety of programs. 

The CSES Codebook can be navigated quickly in the electronic files, with 
the following commands allowing for quick searching:

))) = Section Header. 

>>> = Sub-section Header 1.

<<>> = Sub-section Header 2. 

+++ = Tables.

CSES QUESTION CLASSIFICATION = For survey level variables only, CSES  
Question Classification details whether the variable is part of the CSES  
Core component, which are questions asked repeatedly in CSES Modules, 
whether a variable is part of the CSES Module Theme component, which are  
questions specific to the Module Theme under exploration and might not be 
included in CSES repeatedly, or whether a variable is a Derivative Variable, 
which is explained below. 

VARIABLE NOTES = Notes for particular variables.

ELECTION STUDY NOTES = Notes for a particular election study .

DERIVATIVE VARIABLE = Highlights a variable derived from another 
variable or variables within the CSES.

POTENTIAL POLITY LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging at polity level.

POTENTIAL REGIONAL LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging at regional level.

POTENTIAL TIME BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = 
Highlights a variable that may be used for data bridging by time.

POTENTIAL PARTY/COALITION LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = Highlights a variable 
that may be used for data bridging at party/coalition level.

POTENTIAL CSES PRODUCT BRIDGING IDENTIFIER = Highlights a variable 
that may be used for data bridging with other CSES products.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES PROJECT PROFILE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) is a collaborative
program of research among election study teams from around the world.
Participating polities include a common module of survey questions
in their post-election studies. The resulting data are deposited along
with voting, demographic, district, and macro variables. The studies are
then merged into a single, free, public dataset for use in comparative
study and cross-level analysis.

The CSES project focuses on respondents' behavior and attitudes during 
the time of a national election, with a particular emphasis on voting and 
turnout. Each CSES Module consists of a nationally-representative 
post-election survey and additional variables about the context of the 
overall polity and electoral system within which the respondents find 
themselves. Every five years a new CSES Module is designed with a 
different substantive theme selected to address essential questions 
in electoral studies and social science. 

An international committee of leading scholars of electoral politics and 
political science develop the research agenda, questionnaires, and study 
design. The design is implemented in each polity by their foremost 
social scientists. By collaborating in this way, the CSES community hopes 
to advance scientific inquiry into the relationship between electoral
institutions and political behavior.

The work of the CSES Secretariat is funded by the American National 
Science Foundation, the GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social 
Sciences, and the University of Michigan's Center for Political Studies. 
Details of particular grants that provided funding for MODULE 5 are 
available under the "HOW TO CITE THE CSES MODULE 5 STUDY". 
The project also receives in-kind support from participating election 
studies, additional organizations that sponsor Planning Committee (PC) 
meetings and conferences, and the many organizations that fund national 
election studies that participate in CSES. 

This is the fifth iteration of CSES known as CSES MODULE 5. The remainder
of the project description relates specifically to CSES MODULE 5. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES MODULE 5 STUDY DESCRIPTION - ABSTRACT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSES MODULE 5 is scheduled to officially be in data collection from 2016 to 
2021. Data collection in 2015 is possible for pre-test studies. 

CSES MODULE 5 focuses on the examination of so-called "populist attitudes"
in the population and how they shape electoral behavior. It focuses on the
measurement of three core themes: attitudes towards political elites,
attitudes towards representative democracy and majority rule, and attitudes
towards out-groups.

More information regarding the theme of MODULE 5 can be found in the
CSES MODULE 5 Theoretical Statement available on the CSES website.

>>> CSES MODULE 5 COLLABORATORS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CSES project is extremely grateful to our MODULE 5 Collaborators, who
raised their own funds to include CSES MODULE 5 in a nationally
representative post-election study in their polity or province.

Listed Collaborators are those who appear in the Design Report for the
respective study - they are not necessarily the actors who collected
the data, and they are not necessarily the only investigators on each
study. Most election studies benefited from the scientific input and data
preparation skills of additional persons not listed here.

Within each election study, Collaborators are presented in the order in
which they are listed in the Design Report deposited by each Collaborator
team. The affiliations listed are current as of the date when each
election study's Design Report was deposited with CSES. The polities are
listed in alphabetical order.

                      dataset already prepared and ready to be loaded
                      into STATA.  Missing data statements are not applied.
                      Users of STATA 13 or earlier versions of this
                      programme are advised to use the "cses_syntax.zip"
                      files to load the dataset into their package. 

Please note that all above packages will need a File Extractor 
program downloaded to their computer to be able to Unzip and open the
above files. 

We recommend that PC users create the following directory on their hard
drive, and to download their files from this MODULE 5 release to that 
location:
                 "c:/cses/module5/20230725/"                        

The sub-directory value "20230725" represents the version (release date) of 
the dataset - this being 2023, and the July 25 version of CSES MODULE 5.
This file structure is compatible with how the "cses5_syntax.zip" file
(detailed above) is organized. The method allows users with multiple CSES
dataset's and/or versions to stay organized and not over-write their other 
files. Users of other computer types (Macs, Unix, etc.) are recommended to 
use a similar directory structure to organize their CSES files.

>>> MICRO-LEVEL (SURVEY) COMPONENT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The core questionnaire ("Module") of CSES MODULE 5 was intended to be
administered as a single, uninterrupted block of questions in a nationally
representative post-election survey in each polity.

A) The question text is included in the variable documentation of this
   Codebook. The questions are reported in the order in which they appear
   in the CSES questionnaire. For some questions, Collaborator instructions
   for administering the CSES Questionnaire were important. These
   are reported in the next section.

B) Where there are known differences in the way a particular question was
   administered in an election study, this is noted in the "Election Study
   Notes" following the documentation of the corresponding variable.

C) There are several sets of party and leader evaluation items included
   in the module. These correspond to parties labeled A-F, in descending
   order of vote share, of the six most popular parties in the lower house
   elections (or Presidential elections if legislative elections were not
   held). Where respondents were asked to evaluate other parties, these
   evaluations have been included where possible and are labeled parties
   G-I, regardless of their vote shares. The parties and leaders to which
   these evaluations apply are identified in Codebook Part 3.

D) There are several questions (including the vote choice and party
   identification items) that ask the respondents to specify a political
   party. The codes for these items are also reported in Codebook Part 3.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES MODULE 5 COLLABORATOR INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
    CSES QUESTIONNAIRE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following instructions appeared in the header to the questionnaire for
CSES MODULE 5, as instructions to Collaborators regarding the
implementation of the questionnaire;

  ( 1)  Following these Collaborator instructions, this document is 
        comprised of three sections:

        ))) CSES MODULE 5 QUESTIONNAIRE: ADMINISTRATIVE VARIABLES

        The "Administrative Variables" section is a list of common
        administrative variables that, if possible, should be provided at
        the time data are deposited with the CSES Secretariat.

        ))) CSES MODULE 5 QUESTIONNAIRE: CSES MODULE

        This is the CSES Module itself, a common module of survey questions
        for researchers to include in their national post-election survey.
        The CSES Module is intended to be administered exactly as it is
        specified in this document.

        ))) CSES MODULE 5 QUESTIONNAIRE: DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES

        Collaborators are asked to provide data on background (demographic)
        characteristics of respondents, coded to an agreed upon set of
        standards as indicated in this section. There is great
        international variation in the ways that Collaborators will go
        about soliciting information on the background characteristics of
        their respondents. The objective here is not standardization of the
        way Collaborators ask these background questions, but instead,
        standardization to a common, cross-national scheme for coding each
        variable.

  ( 2)  The CSES Module (consisting of the questions which are named 
        beginning with the letter "Q") is intended to be administered in
        its entirety as a single, uninterrupted block of questions, unless 
        noted otherwise for particular questions. In most cases, the CSES 
        Module is included as part of a larger study. For reliable 
        comparisons to be made, it is important that any additional items
        investigators may wish to include do not interrupt the CSES Module.

  ( 3)  The CSES module should be administered as a post-election
        interview.

  ( 4)  Where the CSES module is included in a larger study, to ensure that
        question-ordering effects are minimized, Collaborators should be
        sensitive to the effects questions asked immediately prior to the
        module may have.

  ( 5)  NOTES often precede the question TEXT, and provide instructions for
        the administration of the item. Where no question TEXT is provided,
        Collaborators should provide documentation of the question used.

  ( 6)  Showcards may be helpful for the administration of some questions.
        For this reason, a Respondent Booklet is available for download
        from the CSES website. The Respondent Booklet contains showcards
        for select questions. It is indicated in the NOTES when a showcard
        is available for a question.
        
  ( 7)  The response options that should be read to the respondent are
        contained in the body of the question TEXT.

  ( 8)  Where lower-case words appear in brackets [ ] Collaborators should
        select the words that are most appropriate.

        For example:
        [party/Presidential candidate]
        ...indicates that either the word "party" or the phrase
        "Presidential candidate" should be read, but not both.

  ( 9)  Where upper-case words appear in brackets [ ] Collaborators should
        substitute the words that are most appropriate.

        For example:
        [COUNTRY]
        ...should be replaced with the name of the country where the
        election was held (perhaps "Canada" or "the Philippines").

        Another example:
        [NUMBER OF YEARS BETWEEN THE PREVIOUS AND THE PRESENT ELECTION
        OR CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT]
        ...should be replaced with a number that indicates the amount of
        years that have passed between the previous election and either the
        current election or recent change in government.

  (10)  Phrases that appear in parentheses ( ) contain words that are
        optional - that Collaborators (or their interviewers) can decide to
        read or not read to respondents as needed.

  (11)  Words in question text that are in upper-case but NOT within 
        brackets [ ] should be emphasized by the interviewer when reading
        the question text. 
        
        For example, the word "COUNTRY" would be emphasized in the
        following question when the interviewer reads the question to the
        respondent:
        
        What COUNTRY do you live in?
        
        But in this next example, the interviewer does not emphasize the
        word "[COUNTRY]". Instead, this is an instruction for the
        Collaborator to substitute the name of the respondent's country
        into the question text (for more information, see the eighth
        Collaborator Instruction above):
        
        How long have you lived in [COUNTRY]?
                        
  (12)  Interviewer instructions are available for some questions. These
        interviewer instructions, labeled as HELP, are intended to
        provide advice to the interviewers to assist in administering the
        question. It is also useful to discuss the interviewer instructions
        as part of interviewer training. The interviewer instructions, 
        where available, appear after the question TEXT. In 
        interviewer-administered surveys, interviewer instructions should
        be available to the interviewer, but not to the respondent. For
        example, in a computer-assisted interview, the interviewer
        instructions might appear on the screen in a special color, and
        interviewers trained to make use of those instructions as
        necessary, but the interviewer should NOT read the interviewer
        instructions to the respondent.
        
  (13)  Some response options are followed by an arrow (->) and a skip
        pattern instruction. If the respondent selects that response 
        option, the skip pattern instruction after the arrow is to be
        executed.

  (14)  Respondents who volunteer the response "DON'T KNOW" (or who have
        REFUSED to answer a question) should be coded as such. Interviewers
        should accept these responses and should NOT probe for additional
        information or force a respondent to use one of the response
        options provided in the text of the question.

  (15)  Special care should be taken in the administration of the Vote 
        Choice items (Q12 and Q13 question series).
        
        Wording for the Q12 and Q13 question series, which is to record
        vote choice in the elections, should follow national standards. 
       
        Collaborators are invited to compare their own national instrument
        with other instruments of countries that are part of the CSES and
        look for convergence where this is possible.
        
        For Q13 (previous election), ask about the previous national 
        election of the same type (whether legislative or Presidential).
        For countries where more than one institution is being currently
        elected on the same day (e.g., President and legislature), please 
        consider asking about the previous lower house election if votes
        have been recorded for the current lower house election. 
        
        For Q12 (current election), for countries where more than one 
        institution is elected on the same day (e.g., President and 
        legislature) using different votes, please ensure that all votes
        are supplied. Consider including all national elections having been
        held within three months before the study's data collection period.
        
        Please ensure all vote choices are supplied as separate variables
        in the dataset that you deposit.
        
        For countries where voters have two votes for the same institution
        (e.g. parallel and mixed member proportional systems; double
        ballot systems), please ensure that both/all votes are supplied.
        
        For countries using preferential systems (e.g., STV, AV) please
        provide first and second preference vote.
          
  (16)  For questions asking about parties, Collaborators should be advised
        that they may add one or several party blocs to a list of
        individual parties if they feel that it will be difficult for
        respondents to recognize individual parties.

  (17)  Collaborators in the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems shall
        adhere to the following standards of data quality:

        a. Mode of interviewing: Interviews should be conducted
           face-to-face, unless local circumstances dictate that telephone,
           Internet, or mail surveys will produce higher-quality data.            
           Mixed-mode surveys are acceptable to increase response rates
           and/or compensate for under coverage associated with particular
           survey modes. In cases of mode variation as well as in cases of
           within-mode variation (e.g., adaption of Internet surveys to 
           multiple devices) presentation of questionnaires to respondents
           should be as similar as possible. All variation within surveys
           shall be documented in detail, and technical information on
           survey mode and, where appropriate, device used shall be
           identified in the data set for each respondent. National studies
           should seek to keep mode changes to a minimum to maximize
           comparability of their data sets across modules.

        b. Timing of interviewing: We strongly recommend that Collaborators
           in the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems conduct their
           interviews in the weeks following their national election. 
           Interviewing should not start later than six months after the
           election. Out of concern for data quality, data collection
           should be completed in as timely a fashion as possible. In the
           event of a runoff election, interviewing shall be conducted 
           after the first round election. The date of interview shall be
           provided for each respondent.

        c. Placement of module in post-election questionnaire: The
           questionnaire module should be asked as a single, uninterrupted
           block of questions. We leave it to each Collaborator to select
           an appropriate location for the module in their national survey
           instrument. Collaborators should take steps to ensure that
           questions asked immediately prior to the questionnaire module
           do not contaminate the initial questions in the module.
           Collaborators are also free to select an appropriate place in
           their survey instrument to ask the turnout, vote choice,
           and demographic questions.

        d. Population to be sampled: National samples should be drawn from
           all age-eligible citizens. No sampling frames with systematic 
           under coverage of significant population groups (such as citizens
           without access to the Internet) are acceptable. When 
           non-citizens (or other non-eligible respondents) are included
           in the sample, a variable should be provided to permit the
           identification of those non-eligible respondents. When a
           Collaborator samples from those persons who appear on voter
           registration lists, the Collaborator should quantify the 
           estimated degree of discrepancy between this population and the
           population of all age-eligible citizens. Studies based on
           panels or access panels are acceptable if dictated by local
           circumstances. In such cases the Collaborator should seek to
           minimize the time lag between initial sampling and the CSES
           survey and quantify the estimated degree of discrepancy to the
           population of all age-eligible citizens and provide weights.
           Details about initial sampling must be documented.

        e. Sampling procedures: We strongly encourage the use of random
           samples, with random sampling procedures used at all stages of
           the sampling process. Collaborators should provide detailed
           documentation of their sampling practices for all stages.

        f. Sample Size: We strongly recommend that no fewer than 1,500
           age-eligible respondents be interviewed, and under no 
           circumstances should fewer than 1,000 age-eligible respondents
           be interviewed.

        g. Interviewer training: Collaborators should pre-test their survey
           instrument and should train interviewers in the administration
           of the questionnaire. The Planning Committee will provide each
           Collaborator with documentation that clarifies the purposes and
           objectives of each item and with rules with respect to probing
           "don't know" responses.

        h. Field practices: Collaborators should make every effort to
           ensure a high response rate. Investigators should be diligent in
           their effort to reach respondents not interviewed on the initial
           contact with the household and should be diligent in their
           effort to convert respondents who initially refuse to
           participate in the study. Data on the number of contact
           attempts, the number of contacts with sample persons, and
           special persuasion or conversion efforts undertaken should be
           coded for each respondent.

        i. Strategies for translation (and back-translation): Each
           Collaborator should translate the questionnaire module into
           their native language(s). To ensure the equivalence of the
           translation, Collaborators shall perform an independent
           re-translation of the questionnaire back into English.
           Collaborators engaged in translation of the questionnaire module
           into the same language (e.g., Spanish, French, English, German,
           and Portuguese) should collaborate on the translation.          
        

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> DISTRICT-LEVEL COMPONENT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The district-level variables report relevant election result data (mostly
pertaining to the lower house elections) for each respondent's district. 
Wherever possible, these data were collected from official sources (see
CSES MODULE 5 Codebook Part 2 and Bibliography in Part 1 for details). 
In other cases, CSES has been grateful for the compilation of these data 
provided by third-party sources.

Parts 2 and 4 of the CSES MODULE 5 Codebook provide more information on 
the district data, including details of any polities where we deviate from 
the CSES conventions as well as the sources of the data for each polity. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> MACRO-LEVEL COMPONENT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To supplement the micro (survey) data, the teams of researchers responsible
for the collection of the public opinion data, also compiled and deposited
the following types of data: electoral legislation, political party
platforms, and official electoral returns.

To facilitate this process, a detailed questionnaire was constructed to
serve as a framework for the macro component of the project. The Macro Data
Reports, completed by the CSES Collaborators, can be found on the CSES
website in the MODULE 5 section under the "Data Center".

Additional measures thought pertinent to the micro-district-macro design
are also compiled and available in the CSES data files.

Sources consulted for the macro level component are listed as appropriate
in the Bibliography at the end of this part of the CSES Codebook.


===========================================================================
))) CSES MODULE 5 DOCUMENTATION - WHAT'S AVAILABLE AND HOW TO USE?
===========================================================================

There are several components to the CSES documentation. We detail each form 
below: 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES CODEBOOK OVERVIEW
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The primary documentation component is the CSES MODULE 5 Codebook. 
The Codebook consists of six components, namely: 

1) PART 1: INTRODUCTION 
   (file name: cses5_codebook_part1_introduction.txt)
   Part 1 (This file) overview of the CSES study and data, information  
   about how to use the files, election study descriptions, information on 
   the CSES data file, the checks the CSES Secretariat conducts on the

   (file name: cses5_codebook_part2_variables.txt)
   Part 2 is the Variable Description file and includes the survey 
   questions, code frames, general variable notes, election study notes, and 
   details about sources for macro data. 

3) PART 3: PARTIES AND LEADERS BY POLITY 
   (file name: cses5_codebook_part3_parties_and_leaders.txt)
   Part 3 details the party/coalition and leader numerical and alphabetical
   classifications for each polity included in the CSES MODULE 5 dataset. 

4) PART 4: PRIMARY ELECTORAL DISTRICTS RESPONDENTS BY POLITY
   (file name: cses5_codebook_part4_primary_electoral_districts.txt)
   Part 4 details the primary electoral district by polity for each 
   respondent included in the CSES MODULE 5 dataset. 

5) PART 5: ELECTION SUMMARIES BY POLITY
   (file name: cses5_codebook_part5_election_summaries.txt)
   Part 5 contains short summaries of each election included in CSES MODULE 
   5. It also provides analysts with details of additional sources they may 
   wish to consult to understand the elections included in CSES in greater
   detail. 

6) PART 6: STUDY DESIGN AND WEIGHTS OVERVIEW BY POLITY
   (file name: cses5_codebook_part6_designs_and_weights.txt)
   Part 6 contains overviews of the design of each election study included 
   in CSES MODULE 5. It also provides analysts with details regarding the 
   polity weights provided by each election study. 

The CSES MODULE 5 questionnaire is also available from the website or
by referencing the corresponding variables in this Codebook.

For all election studies included in CSES, Collaborators have provided 
documentation to accompany their election studies. These documents, 
where available, can be found on the CSES MODULE 5 download page.

Analysts will also want to become familiar with the CSES MODULE 5 errata
page. It is accessible from the CSES MODULE 5 download page under "Data
Center" on the CSES website. Information, updates, and error notifications
and corrections are posted there, in real time, as they become available.
Please regularly check for errata notifications to keep up to date.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES CODEBOOK CONVENTIONS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CSES project uses American English language and date standards 
(MM-DD-YYYY). In the CSES MODULE 5 dataset, all variables begin with the 
letter "E" (E being the fifth letter of the English alphabet and thus 
signifying MODULE 5). This convention helps reduce the possibility of 
overwriting data when merging with other CSES datasets.

Variables are presented in five groupings:

1) E1001-E1999 Identification, weight, and election study variables

2) E2001-E2999 Demographic data

3) E3001-E3999 Micro-level (survey) data (the CSES MODULE 5 questionnaire)

4) E4001-E4999 District-level data

5) E5000-E5999 Macro-level data

6) E6000-E6999 IMD bridging Variables

In the Variable Descriptions portion of the CSES MODULE 5 Codebook (Part 2),
the headers for individual variables are surrounded by two lines of dashes. 
Variable names do not exceed eight characters in length.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES CODEBOOK - VARIABLE NOTES AND ELECTION STUDY NOTES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<>> VARIABLES NOTES

Variable Notes provide information on the rationale of a variable 
as well as source information for that variable. It also details the 
polities for which no data for that particular variable are available. 
VARIABLES NOTES are listed below the descriptive information for the said
variable and can be navigated in the Codebook by searching for 
"VARIABLES NOTES" in Part 2 of the CSES Codebook. 


<<>> ELECTION STUDY NOTES

A unique dimension of the CSES are the inclusion of ELECTION STUDY NOTES. 
They are notes which are attached to each variable included in the dataset
and refer to case specific information regarding a particular variable. 
Their purpose is to provide users with more detailed information on the 
case or explain important deviations specific to cases from CSES 
conventions. They are also used to provide source data information for 
users. Where applicable, ELECTION STUDY NOTES are listed below a particular
variable and any VARIABLES NOTES in Parts 2 and 3 of the CSES codebook. 
They can be navigated in the Codebook by searching for "ELECTION STUDY 
NOTES" in Parts 2 and 3 of the CSES MODULE 5 Codebook.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES ORIGINAL QUESTIONNAIRE FOR MODULE 5
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CSES MODULE 5 original questionnaire is available from the CSES Module 
5 study page at: 
         https://cses.org/data-download/cses-module-5-2016-2021/
        (Date accessed: July 15, 2023).     
         
or by referencing the corresponding Variable Descriptions in this Codebook 
(see Part 2).


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES - ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

All election studies included in CSES provide numerous source material. 
These documents include the following: 
      - Macro Reports. 
      - Design Reports. 
      - Original questionnaires including in the language of origin. 

We describe each in turn below. 


<<>> MACRO REPORT

Collaborators submit a Macro Report to the CSES Secretariat when depositing
their national data. Its purpose is to provide a coherent link between 
national level specialists and data specific to the election and polity 
in question. It provides information on the election, the composition of 
cabinet before and after election, expert assessments of the parties, 
information on electoral rules operating in the polity, as well as original
sources for the polity level data. It aids the CSES Secretariat in 
collating some of the macro level data for each polity included in the 
study. Where available, Macro Reports can be found on the CSES MODULE 5 
download page under "CSES MODULE 5 Election Study Archive" at:
https://cses.org/data-download/cses-module-5-2016-2021/


<<>> DESIGN REPORT

Collaborators also submit a Design Report to the CSES Secretariat when 
depositing their national data. It provides all information on the 
implementation of each individual election study including details
regarding fieldwork dates, mode of interview, sampling procedures, 
sampling frame, response and refusal rates, information on translation
procedures, and weights. Some of this data is included directly in the
CSES data in variables E1001-E1039. Where available, Design Reports can 
be found on the CSES MODULE 5 download page under "CSES MODULE 5 Election
Study Archive" at: https://cses.org/data-download/cses-module-5-2016-2021/

Further, Part 6 of the CSES MODULE 5 Codebook provides overviews of each 
polity's study design and polity level weights. It draws heavily on
information from each polity's Design Report.


<<>> ORIGINAL QUESTIONNAIRES

Where available, CSES provides the original language questionnaires from 
each polity's national election study. Further, CSES requests that all 
studies included provide the English language questionnaire used as the 
basis for translation of the CSES questionnaire into a polity's native
tongue(s). Where available, the questionnaires can be found on the CSES 
MODULE 5 download page under "CSES MODULE 5 Election Study Archive" at:
https://cses.org/data-download/cses-module-5-2016-2021/


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> HOW TO NAVIGATE THE CSES MODULE 5 CODEBOOK
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CSES MODULE 5 Codebook is produced in .txt format to allow for easy 
accessibility and as such the Codebook can be read into a variety of 
programs. The Codebook is also partially machine readable.  

The CSES MODULE 5 Codebook can be navigated quickly in the electronic files, 
with the following commands allowing for quick searching:

<<>> = Sub-section Header 2

+++ = Tables

CSES QUESTION CLASSIFICATION = For survey level variables only, CSES  
Question Classification details whether the variable is part of the CSES  
Core component, which are questions asked repeatedly in CSES Modules, 
whether a variable is part of the CSES Module Theme component, which are  
questions specific to the Module Theme under exploration and might not be 
included in CSES repeatedly, or whether a variable is a Derivative Variable, 
which is explained below. 

VARIABLES NOTES = Notes for particular variables.  

ELECTION STUDY NOTES = Notes for a particular election study.  

DERIVATIVE VARIABLE = Highlights a variable derived from another 
variable or variables within the CSES.

POTENTIAL POLITY LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER =

))) CSES MODULE 5 STUDY DATA AND CODEBOOK: ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
===========================================================================

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CODING OF PARTIES/COALITIONS & LEADERS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSES classifies parties/coalitions in its dataset numerically and
alphabetically. Below we provide explanations of both of these coding
schemes. The details of each party/leader classification are available in  
Part 3 of the CSES MODULE 5 Codebook. 

<<>> CSES NUMERICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING

Each party/coalition is assigned a unique numerical code which consists of  
two components and six digits in total:
    - the first three digits indicate the numerical country UN code
    - the latter three digits indicate the numerical party code within
      the given election study.

All parties/coalitions or Presidential candidates, where applicable,
participating in the election or the previous election receive a numerical
code. These codes are used to identify the following: 
    - who respondent's feel best represented by (variable E3010_2).
    - who a respondent voted for in the current election 
      (variable E3013).
    - who the respondent voted for in the previous election 
      (variable E3015).
    - the respondent's party identification (variable E3024).
      
The numerical coding is also used to identify macro level information about
the parties/coalitions, namely: 
    - which party/coalition held the Presidency before and after the
      elections (variable E5009 and E5013).
    - which party/coalition held the Prime Ministership before and after
      the elections (variable E5010 and E5014).
     
Numerical codes assigned to parties/coalitions are consistent for the 
current and previous election.  

<<>> CSES ALPHABETICAL PARTY/COALITION CODING
 
Parties/coalitions A through F are the six most popular parties/coalitions, 
ordered in descending order of their share of the popular vote in the 
parliamentary election (unless otherwise stated). Thus, Party A is the 
party/coalition that received the most votes in the election, party B the 
second most votes, etc...

Parties/coalitions who achieve at least 1% of the vote nationally are
eligible for an alphabetical A-F assignment. In countries with multiple
electoral tiers and where one vote is cast, parties are ordered according
to their vote share in tier 1 (the lowest tier), unless otherwise stated.
In countries where voters have two votes (i.e.: a constituency and a list
vote) simultaneously, for example Germany, parties are ordered by the
national share of the party list vote (tier 2) unless stated otherwise.

Parties G, H, and I are supplemental parties. They may, but do not have to,
accord with how parties A-F are ordered, that is ordered on the popular 
share of the vote in a polity. More often, they are codified in no 
particular order. These parties are voluntarily provided by each polity's
election study and often reflect important or notable parties within a 
polity. They may also include data about individual parties within a 
coalition, where data about the coalition and the individual parties, 
or some of these parties that make it up, are provided.
These codes are used to identify the following in the micro component of 
the CSES dataset: 
    - Respondent's likeability of the party/coalition (variable E3017).
    - Respondent's left-right placement of the party/coalition (variable 
      E3019).

These alphabetical codes are used to identify district and macro level
information about these said parties/coalitions, namely:
    - The said party/coalition's vote share in the respondent's electoral
      district (variable E4004).
    - the said party/coalition's share of the seats in the election in the
      respondent's electoral district (variable E4005)
    - the said party/coalition's share of the vote in the election 
      (variable E5001, E5003, and E5005).
    - the said party/coalition's share of the seats in the election 
      (variable E5002 and E5004).
    - the said party/coalition's share of cabinet portfolios before and 
      after the election (variable E5011 and E5015).
    - expert judgements by the national Collaborators of the said party/
      coalition's ideological family (variable E5017).
    - expert judgements by the national Collaborators of the said party/
      coalition's left-right placement (variable E5018).
    - expert judgements by the national Collaborators of the said party/
      coalition's level of populism (variable E5020).
    - The said party/coalition's Manifesto Research on Political 
      Representation (MARPOR/CMP) Identifier (variable E5200).
    - The said party/coalition's Parliaments and Government Database
      (ParlGov) Identifier (variable E5201).   
    - The said party/coalition's Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES) Identifier 
      (variable E5202).
    - The said party/coalition's Party Facts Identifier (variable E5203). 


<<>> CSES ALPHABETICAL LEADER CODING
         
Leaders A through F tend to be the leaders of the six most popular parties/
coalitions or the Presidential candidates of these parties. In most 
instances, they correspond to parties/coalitions A-F (i.e.: Leader A will 
be related to Party A in some way, Leader B will be related to 
Party B, etc.).

Leaders G, H, and I are supplemental leaders. They may be related to
parties G, H, I but they do not have to be. These leaders are voluntarily
provided by each polity's election study and often include data about
additional personalities of interest. For example, in a parliamentary
system, data about a President might be provided, even if the Presidency
is not being contested. On many occasions, slots Leader G, H, and I will
include additional data for parties/coalitions that have multiple leaders.
These codes are used to identify the following in the micro and macro
components of the CSES dataset: 
    - Respondent's likeability of the leader/personality in question
      (variable E3018).


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> CSES DATA BRIDGING: NEW FRONTIERS IN DATA LINKAGE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data Bridging enables users to bring together information from CSES with 
other data sources. The concept is part of CSES Data Linkage efforts. CSES
has been a pioneer of Data Linkage with the inclusion of various 
macro-level data originating from other sources (e.g., The World Bank, 
the IDEA) directly in CSES data products, including in CSES MODULE 5. These 
macro data classify the political system's characteristics and contextual 
conditions of a polity at the election time.  
Data Bridging gives users the power to build on the direct data linkage 
in CSES products by enabling users to easily link other data with CSES 
products. CSES MODULE 5 enables users to bridge data with other prominent 
datasets in political science by including standard identifiers at the
polity, year, and party level used by other projects to facilitate 
merging.

CSES MODULE 5 facilitates data bridging with other datasets at the polity 
level with the following variables:
    - E1006_UN       ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN ISO_3166-1 NUMERIC CODE
    - E1006_UNALPHA2 ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN ISO_3166-1 ALPHABETIC
                                    TWO LETTER CODE
    - E1006_UNALPHA3 ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN ISO_3166-1 ALPHABETIC
                                    THREE LETTER CODE
    - E1006_NAM      ID COMPONENT - POLITY NAME
    - E1006_VDEM     ID COMPONENT - V-Dem POLITY IDENTIFIER
    
More details can be found on all these variables in CSES Codebook Part 2
by searching for the variable name (e.g., "E1006_UN") or using the search
term "POTENTIAL POLITY LEVEL BRIDGING IDENTIFIER". 


CSES MODULE 5 facilitates data bridging with other datasets at the regional

>>> DERIVATIVE VARIABLES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSES MODULE 5 includes several Derivative Variables. A Derivative Variable 
is a variable that is derived from another variable or variables within the 
CSES. Their purpose is to facilitate speedier analysis for users with 
derivative variables capturing some of the most common analytical concepts 
in the discipline.

A list of the DERIVATIVE VARIABLES are below this explanation and can be
navigated in the Codebook by searching for DERIVATIVE VARIABLES in
Part 2 of the CSES MODULE 5 Codebook.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> IDENTIFICATION VARIABLES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are several Identification Variables in CSES MODULE 5 which allow
users to not only identify an individual respondent, but election studies, 
and polities. 


<<>> ELECTION STUDY IDENTIFIERS

Each Election Study in CSES MODULE 5 is uniquely identified by two 
variables, namely: 

   - variable E1003 ID VARIABLE - ELECTION STUDY (NUMERIC POLITY)
     This variable is an eight-digit numerical code constructed from two
     components: the CSES polity code (variable E1006) and the 
     year in which the election took place (E1008). The first three digits
     represent the country codes assigned by the United Nations Statistics
     Division. The fourth digit distinguishes between multiple election
     studies within a single country for the same election. The final 
     four digits represent the year of the election. 
     E.g., 04002017. AUSTRIA (2017)

   - variable E1004 ID VARIABLE - ELECTION STUDY (ALPHABETIC POLITY)
     This variable is an alphanumerical code constructed from two
     components: the alpha-3 country codes assigned by the United Nations
     Statistics Divisions. The remaining characters correspond 
     to the year of the election. 
     E.g., USA_2016


<<>> POLITY IDENTIFIERS

Each Polity in CSES MODULE 5 is uniquely identified by two 
variables, namely: 

   - variable E1006_UN ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN ISO_3166-1 NUMERIC CODE
     This variable consists of the three-digit numerical country codes 
     assigned by the United Nations Statistics Division to polities
     in line with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
     The numerical codes are maintained by the United Nations Statistics 
     Division and are based on the M49 UN framework. 
     E.g., 040. AUSTRIA (2017)

   - variable E1006_UNALPHA2 ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN ISO_3166-1 
     ALPHABETIC TWO LETTER CODE
     This variable consists of the two-letter country codes assigned by 
     the United Nations Statistics Division to polities based on the 
     International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The lettered
     codes are maintained by the ISO as part of their ISO3166-1 standard. 
     E.g., DE. Germany (DE=Deutschland)

   - variable E1006_UNALPHA3 ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN ISO_3166-1 
     ALPHABETIC THREE LETTER CODE
     This variable consists of the three-letter country codes assigned by 
     the United Nations Statistics Division to polities based on the 
     International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The lettered
     codes are maintained by the ISO as part of their ISO3166-1 standard. 
     E.g., PRT. Portugal (PRT=Portugal)

   - variable E1006_NAM ID COMPONENT - POLITY NAME
     This variable consists of polity names based on those used by the
     United Nations Statistics Division. 
     E.g., Greece 

These polity identifiers allow for easy data bridging with other macro
data sources such as the World Bank. 


<<>> POLITY GEOGRAPHIC IDENTIFIERS

   - variable E1006_REG ID COMPONENT - POLITY UN GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS NUMERIC
                                       CODES
     This variable consists of a two-digit numerical code assigned by the
     United Nations Statistics Division to polities based on their 
     geographic (continental) region. Each polity is shown in one 
     region only. 


<<>> POLITY MEMBERSHIP IDENTIFIERS

CSES MODULE 5 classifies whether each polity was a member of two 
international organizations at the time of the election, namely the  
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the  
European Union (EU).

   - variable E1006_OECD ID COMPONENT - POLITY MEMBER OF OECD
     This variable classifies whether polity was a member of the 
     Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) at the
     time of the election. 

   - variable E1006_EU ID COMPONENT - POLITY MEMBER OF EU
     This variable classifies whether polity was a member of the European
     Union at the time of the election. 


<<>> RESPONDENT IDENTIFIER

Respondents can be uniquely identified in the dataset by variable E1005. It
is an 18-character identifier. The first three characters are the numeric
version of the country codes assigned by the United Nations Statistics
Division. If applicable, the fourth character distinguishes between 
multiple studies conducted within a single country, for the same election. 
If only one study is in place for the election, this digit is 0. The fifth
through eighth characters correspond to the election year (see variable
E1008). The last ten characters are the respondent identifier from E1009,
which is unique within each election study.


<<>> COVID-19 PANDEMIC IDENTIFIER

Some studies were conducted either partially or completely during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. A pandemic is an epidemic of infectious disease that has 
spread across a large region or multiple or worldwide and affecting a
substantial number of individuals.                   
At the time of writing, COVID-19 was first discovered in November 2019. 
However, it is possible human-to-human transmission of the disease was 
occurring before this discovery. On January 11, 2020, the World Health 
Organization (WHO) was notified by Chinese authorities of a virus outbreak 
in Wuhan, China. On January 30,2020, the World Health Organization 
classified COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of Concern before 
eventually declaring the Health situation a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
An election (or election study) is classified as taking place during the 
COVID-19 pandemic if the election itself took place and/or the entire study 
fieldwork was administered on or after March 11, 2020 to December 31, 2021, 
the end of the CSES MODULE 5 Fieldwork. March 11, 2020, is the day in which
the World Health Organization (WHO) officially classified the COVID-19 
Health Crisis as a pandemic. CSES classifies whether the election took 
place before, partially, or fully during the pandemic - this is identified
in the dataset by variable E1038. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> MISSING DATA
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Multiple response categories can relate to missing data relating from 
not applicable to a respondent refusing to answer or failing to answer 
a question. Users should consult individual variables for the specific
missing designations assigned to each variable. 

For some election studies in which we could not distinguish among various
answers, the code "missing" may include cases where respondents refused 
to answer the question, "don't know" responses, and cases where there
a particular question went unanswered for other reasons.
Moreover, while CSES guidelines request that the response categories 
"Refused" and "Don't Know" be volunteered responses, this was not always 
consistently applied. For instance, sometimes the options were offered 
explicitly to respondents in mail-back surveys, which do not have the 
benefit of an interviewer being present. To identify whether the response 
options were volunteered (or not) in a particular election study, users 
should refer to the original questionnaires of each polity. These are
available on the MODULE 5 page. 

While there is no consistent CSES convention regarding the application of
missing values, some commonalities exist, namely: 
- Not applicable values are commonly designated as 7, 97, 997, 9997 etc...
- Don't know values are commonly designated as 8, 98, 998, 9998 etc... 
- Missing values are commonly designated as 9, 99, 999, 9999 etc...

However, users are advised that the commonalities do not always hold
and they are advised to consult individual variables for the specific
missing designations assigned to the variable in question. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> WEIGHTS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSES provides several weight measures in the CSES data (see variables 
E1010-E1014 inclusive). There is a strong degree of variance in the sample 
designs used in the national election studies included in CSES. Hence, the
weights provided by Collaborators vary significantly. Users are advised
to read carefully about the different weights in CSES to ascertain
whether their analyses should be subjected to weighting and if so which
kind. 

CSES provides users with up to three original weights from each 
national election study (see variable E1010_) namely:

  - SAMPLE WEIGHT (variable E1010_1): 
    intended to correct for unequal selection probabilities resulting from 
    booster samples procedures for selection within the household, 
    non-response, or other sample design features 

  - DEMOGRAPHIC WEIGHT (variable E1010_2): 
    intended to adjust sample distributions of socio-demographic 
    characteristics to more closely resemble the characteristics of the 
    population

  - POLITICAL WEIGHT (variable E1010_3): 
    intended to reconcile discrepancies in the reported electoral behavior
    of respondents' vis-a-vis official electoral counts. 

For more information on polity weights, users are advised to consult Part 6
of the CSES Codebook or the individual design reports of each study. 

The remainder of the weight variables in the dataset are derivative
weights, constructed from the original weights. They are: 
 
  - FACTOR WEIGHTS (variable E1011)
    These variables report the mean weight of each type, within each 
    polity. The resulting factors are then used to create the derivative 
    Polity Weights (variable E1012 explained below). 

  - POLITY WEIGHTS (variable E1012)
    These variables report standardized versions (with a mean 1 within the 
    polity) of the original weights provided with the component election 
    studies, described in E1010. They are the ratio of each weighting 
    factor to the mean weight (E1011) of each type, calculated within each
    polity.

  - SAMPLE SIZE ADJUSTMENT WEIGHT (variable E1013)
    This variable reports the ratio of the average sample size to each 
    election study sample. The resulting factor is then used to create the
    derivative Dataset Weights, see varaible E1014. 

  - DATASET WEIGHTS (variable E1014)
    These variables are intended for micro-level analyses involving the 
    entire CSES sample. Using the sample size adjustment (E1013), the 
    centered weights (E1012) are corrected such that each election study
    component contributes equally to the analysis, regardless of the 
    original sample size. 

Details of the calculation of the above derivative weights, including 
the precise STATA code used to create the weights, can be found in the 
variable notes for variables E1011, E1012, E1013, and E1014.     

Analysts are advised to read the weight documentation carefully to ensure
their analyses are weighted appropriately (if applicable). The CSES 
project does not provide advice as to which weights are appropriate to 
use in particular circumstances. This is best left to analysts to decide 
based on their detailed knowledge of the research question under 
investigation. We advise analysts to consult variable notes E1010-E1014 
for more specific information on each polities weight and the derivative 
weights calculated for the Cross-National Dataset.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> FREEDOM STATUS OF ELECTIONS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The majority of studies that comprise CSES are collected in countries that
have free or partly free elections. However, sometimes a Collaborator will
include the CSES module in a study of a polity that is a developing
democracy or that is considered not free. If the data collection is judged
to be of sufficiently high quality, the study is included in CSES datasets
even if the polity is considered to be not free. The decision regarding
inclusion of particular polities in an analysis is thus left to users. 

To assist users in making appropriate decisions concerning their 
analysis, CSES MODULE 5 includes two measures about the freedom 
and liberty of a polity in the year the election was held (and indeed
the two preceding years), namely: 

   - FREEDOM HOUSE RATING (variables E5090_)
     Freedom House assigns a numerical rating of a polity on a scale of 
     1 to 7 providing an indication of freedom. 

   - POLITY IV DEMOCRACY-AUTOCRACY RATING (variables E5091_)
     Polity IV assigns a numerical rating to a polity on a scale of -10 
     to 10 indicating whether the polity is strongly
     democratic or strongly autocratic. 

Freedom House and Polity IV are not affiliated with the CSES project.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> PROCESSING CHECKS OF MODULE 5 DATASET BY THE CSES SECRETARIAT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Besides processing MODULE 5 studies from individual polities to ensure they
are fit for comparative analysis, which involves detailed checking of the 
individual studies' data, a key role of the CSES Secretariat is to perform
several checks on the MODULE 5 Dataset before it is released. These checks
include (but are not confined to): 

   - CHECK OF DUPLICATE IDs
     Identification of respondents with corresponding answers to all 
     questions or respondent identification data that are similar. 

   - DERIVATIVE VARIABLES CHECKS
     To identify all derivative variables created by the CSES Secretariat
     are coded in line with original variables and documented in the CSES
     Codebook comprehensively. 

   - INCONSISTENCY CHECKS
     To identify sets of variables which are inconsistent, or could be 
     perceived as inconsistent (e.g., strange skip pattern, incompatible
     answers to related questions). The CSES convention is not to change 
     data that we receive from national Collaborators. Instead, 
     inconsistencies are noted in the CSES Codebook under the appropriate
     variable and the data are left unchanged. This allows users to make
     the final determination on whether inconsistencies may affect their
     analyses.  

   - IRREGULAR AND EXTRAORDINARY CODE CHECKS 
     To identify irregular and extraordinary codes in the CSES MODULE 5 
     Dataset. Sometimes these irregular or extraordinary codes are 
     legitimate in the sense that they may be accounted for by a polity
     deviation on a particular variable.

   - THEORETICAL CHECKS  
     These checks explore expected relationships between variables that 
     we might expect to occur (e.g., correlation between Political Efficacy
     and Satisfaction with Democracy). We do this by exploring 
     distributions, correlation analysis, and regression analysis. 

   - VARIABLE AND VALUE LABEL CHECKS
     Checking all variables in the CSES MODULE 5 Dataset to ensure they
     are appropriately assigned labels and documented in the CSES Codebook. 

   - INTERVIEW(ER) VALIDATION CHECKS
     Review performed at the respondent and interviewer levels using various
     statistical techniques to identify anomalous response patterns in the
     data (e.g., identification of highly similar interviews, 
     straightlining, unusually high proportion of interviews conducted by an
     individual interviewer on a single day).
